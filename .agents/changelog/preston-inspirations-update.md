- New **`update-published-inspiration`** skill: the pathway for a publisher to create a new
  version of an inspiration they already published (v2, v3, ...). It locates the
  inspiration from the version ledger, shows what changed in the workspace since
  the last publish, and ASKS the user which of those changes they want in the
  update. It then launches a background worker to implement it -- and the core
  safety rule is that it **re-assembles from the published tip, never from the
  raw template base**, so the user's own customizations (the finished manifest
  prose, the recipe, the bespoke thumbnail, the welcome, and adopters' adaptation
  history) are preserved and only the approved changes are overlaid. The recipe's
  exclusions and modification rules are re-applied, secrets are re-scanned, the
  result is boot-checked, a `### v(n+1)` Publication-history entry is appended,
  and exactly one clean commit is fast-forwarded onto the published repo (no
  force). The workspace ledger records the new version only after the push
  succeeds.

- New **`update-installed-inspiration`** skill: the ADOPTER pathway to pull a newer
  version of an already-adopted inspiration from its remote into the current
  mind. It reuses `use-inspiration`'s safeguards -- the same trust gate (Imbue
  has not verified it, it could be malicious; confirm before fetching), and a
  merge done in an isolated worktree with a boot smoke-check that lands into the
  live tree only when clean. Its central rule is to **preserve this mind's own
  adaptations**: merge conflicts are surfaced as holes and resolved
  interactively with the user, never mechanically or with a blanket "take
  theirs", so the customizations that make it the user's mind are never thrown
  away. It records the version it moved to under a new `## Adopted inspirations`
  section of the ledger.

- **Adopting an inspiration is now gated and verified.** Before the merge path
  pulls a third-party inspiration into a mind, `use-inspiration` requires the
  user to confirm they trust the source -- stating plainly that Imbue has not
  verified it and it could contain malicious code -- and does nothing (no fetch,
  merge, or execution) until they agree. The merge itself now happens in an
  isolated worktree with a boot smoke-check, and only a clean, bootable result
  is fast-forwarded into the live tree, so a broken or hostile inspiration can
  never clobber the mind. A mind created directly FROM an inspiration is treated
  as already trusted (creating it was the trust decision).

- The workspace version ledger is `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md`, with three
  sections: `## Workspace` (template version created-from + each `update-self`
  landing), `## Inspirations` (each inspiration this mind published, `v1`/`v2`...
  per slug), and `## Adopted inspirations` (each inspiration this mind adopted
  and the version it is on). Instead of a separate helper skill, each writer --
  `update-self`, `publish-inspiration`, `update-published-inspiration`, and
  `update-installed-inspiration` -- carries its own self-contained instructions
  telling the agent exactly which line to append and how (section, format, how
  the version number is computed, the idempotence check, and that it is one file
  staged by name and committed, never `git add -A`). The two subtle rules are
  spelled out where they apply: record the `update-self` MERGE commit, not
  `HEAD` (committing the ledger moves `HEAD`), and resolve the template version
  by reachability (`git describe`), not `git tag --points-at`.

- **`update-self`** now records the version it moved to as part of landing an
  update, so a workspace's template lineage is visible in its own git tree.

- The publish skill now confirms the **adopter's required permissions with the
  publisher**. The manifest's "Prerequisites" -- what the inspiration's user must
  grant for the app to work -- are surfaced back in the chat confirmation in
  plain language, and the publisher's answer is part of the go-ahead. A missing
  or wrong line is fixed before the push, since a gap there silently breaks
  adoption.

- **An inspiration can be anything committable**, not just an app: a skill, a
  chat customization or behavior, a workflow, a service, config, or seed data.
  If the user wants to snapshot something that is not committed to git -- an
  ephemeral chat behavior, conversation history, runtime-only state -- the skill
  recognizes this and suggests turning it into something committable first (most
  often by crystallizing it into a skill), since an inspiration must be
  reconstructable from the committed tree.

- **LLM access is now a first-class prerequisite.** Any inspiration whose code
  calls Claude records how it reaches it, because that differs per environment:
  the keyed path (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set -> litellm, pay-per-token) or the
  keyless path (`claude -p` -> the subscription credit pool). The manifest gains
  a `requires_llm:` line naming the method the code was built against, so an
  adopter on the other method knows to switch the model calls, and a hardcoded
  path is also listed as a Hole.

- **Published inspiration repos are locked down on creation** -- unconditionally
  (public or private) and without asking, using GitHub's 2026 pull-request-access
  setting. Right after the repo is created, one PATCH restricts pull requests to
  collaborators (`pull_request_creation_policy: collaborators_only`, so arbitrary
  outsiders cannot open a PR) and disables issues, wiki, projects, and
  discussions outright. This closes every surface where a non-collaborator could
  open or inject content. Two residual limits remain, surfaced only if the user
  chooses public visibility: the REST API can only RESTRICT pull requests to
  collaborators, not fully disable them (the disable toggle is UI-only), and
  forking cannot be disabled on a personal public repo (GitHub allows that only
  on org-owned repos). On a private inspiration neither matters, since outsiders
  have no access at all.

- **Published manifests now carry a changelog.** Each `inspiration-<slug>.md`
  has a "Publication history" section -- the inspiration's own changelog of what
  each published version changed, seeded at v1 with `### v1 (date) -- what this
  first version publishes`. It is the publisher's log (a later update appends
  `### v2 (date) -- what changed`), kept distinct from the adopters'
  "Adaptation history". The section is FILL-IN-gated like the rest of the
  manifest, so a publish cannot complete with it left as a placeholder.

- **Published manifests now carry a version and a recipe.** Each
  `inspiration-<slug>.md` records `version: v1` and a "Recipe" section: the
  include paths, the deliberate exclusions, and the published-version
  modification RULES (rules only -- never the removed values). An inspiration is
  derived from its workspace by that recipe rather than being a fork of it, so a
  later update re-runs the recipe against the current workspace instead of
  diffing two repos -- which is what keeps anything deliberately excluded
  excluded, even though it still exists in the source workspace.

- A publish records its entry in the workspace's ledger only **after the push
  succeeds** -- one single-file commit, documented as the one explicit exception
  to the rule that the live workspace is untouched after assembly. An
  unpublished inspiration is never recorded.

- A published inspiration never ships version history at all: `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md`
  is a workspace artifact, so the assembled snapshot drops it entirely (rather
  than shipping an empty copy). The slugs, repo URLs, and source commits of a
  mind's other inspirations therefore never appear inside one it publishes, and a
  mind created from the inspiration grows its own ledger on demand.
