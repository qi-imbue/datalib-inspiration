Document the app-icon flags in the build-app skill.

`forward_port.py` now takes an optional `--icon` (SVG markup) or `--icon-file` (a path whose contents are read at registration time), so an app can register the glyph the workspace draws for it. The CLI reference lists both, along with what the validation accepts — a single `<svg>` element, no script, style, event handler or external reference, at most 16384 characters — and the rule that omitting them leaves an already-registered icon alone.

The public-URL reference no longer claims `apps.toml` holds only `name` and `url`; it holds the service `label` and any registered `icon` markup too, and still never a public URL.

The layout-driving skills speak projects natively. `manage-layout`'s "Named layouts" primer is now a "Views" primer -- a view is a project or Everything, an op with no target goes to the view the connected client is looking at, `--view` addresses another one (`--layout` is the same flag under its old name), and the read ops take `--device desktop|mobile` for a view's per-device arrangement. The retired `for L in desktop mobile; do ... --layout "$L" ...; done` loops in build-app, caretaker, update-self, update-app, update-system-interface, and migrate-workspace collapse into single un-flagged calls that land in the user's current view.

`manage-layout` documents the new `layout.py views` subcommand for listing the machine's views (projects + Everything) with members and per-client presence.

`manage-layout` documents that agent-opened tabs are filed into the agent's own project (its `project` label) when it has one, falling back to the view the tab opened in.
