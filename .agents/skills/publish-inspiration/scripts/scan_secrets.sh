# Hard-failing secret scan over explicit paths, shared by the
# publish-inspiration flow: build_inspiration.sh (section 5) runs it over the
# staged overlay, and the assembly worker re-runs it over any
# published-version-modified files.
#
# The scan runs TWO independent scanners over the same targets, BOTH of which
# must pass -- a finding from EITHER of them fails the scan:
#
#   - betterleaks: `betterleaks dir` with the sibling betterleaks.toml config
#     (default ruleset + credential-filename path rules + a broad Anthropic
#     key rule). Live validation of findings is off by default and never
#     enabled here.
#   - kingfisher: `kingfisher scan` ALWAYS with --no-validate -- live
#     validation would send candidate secrets to third-party APIs, which must
#     never happen with scanned content.
#
# There is NO fallback scanner and NO tolerance for a missing or broken tool:
# a missing binary or a scanner that errors at runtime fails the scan (a
# broken scanner must never silently pass). The two binaries are baked into
# the workspace image at build time; if one is missing, running
# system/scripts/install_secret_scanners.sh (the single source of truth for the
# version pins) installs both.
#
# Output: one line per finding on stderr naming the scanner, rule/detector,
# and path -- secret VALUES are never printed (betterleaks and kingfisher both
# redact their reports). Finding paths under a scanned directory target are
# printed relative to that directory: the stage dir holds files at their
# repo-relative locations, so findings print repo-relative.
#
# Usage: scan_secrets.sh [--config <betterleaks-toml>] <path> [<path> ...]
# Exit codes: 0 = both scanners ran and found nothing;
#             1 = findings, or a scanner missing/errored, or a target missing;
#             2 = usage error.
