# Assemble a clean, shareable "inspiration" snapshot on top of the DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE base the
# mind was created from, then commit it. Run by the launch-task WORKER the
# publish-inspiration skill dispatches, from the worker's own git worktree
# (cwd = worktree repo root); the live mind's /home/user/workspace is never touched. This is
# v1 of the inspirations flow (see INSPIRATION_FLOW_VERSION below); the
# generated manifest records it as `format: v1` in its front-matter.
#
# The dev `create-new-mind-repo` recipe is NOT available in the VM, so this is
# self-contained. It does the assembly + secret scan + manifest/thumbnail +
# /welcome rewrite + version-history removal + boot smoke-check + single commit.
# It does NOT create the
# GitHub repo or push, and it deliberately leaves two things unfinished for the
# worker to complete before reporting done: the manifest's FILL-IN blocks (real
# prose) and the placeholder thumbnail (a bespoke, app-specific SVG). The lead
# owns the chat confirmation, GitHub login, and push.
#
# Known-correct methods embedded here (a prior build got these wrong):
#   - Clean base via `git read-tree -u --reset` + `git clean -fdxq`, NEVER
#     `git checkout <ref> -- .` (which leaks the mind's whole committed tree,
#     incl. secrets). No upstream fetch/pull -- provenance link only.
#   - Overlay via `rsync -a "$STAGE/" "$REPO/"` (root-to-root), NEVER
#     `cp -a "$STAGE/apps" "$REPO/apps"` (nests into apps/apps).
#   - Secret scan is a hard-failing (exit-non-zero, abort-before-commit) gate
#     -- the authoritative blocker. It runs the sibling scan_secrets.sh, which
#     requires BOTH scanners (betterleaks with the sibling betterleaks.toml
#     config, kingfisher with --no-validate) and fails on any finding, any
#     scanner error, or any missing scanner binary. There is NO fallback
#     scanner: the binaries are baked into the workspace image, so a missing
#     one is a broken environment.
#   - Boot smoke-check via the supervisor python lib (realize/process_config),
#     NEVER `supervisord -t` (in supervisord, -t means --strip_ansi and LAUNCHES
#     the daemon).
#
# Exit codes: 0 = success; 1 = secret scan hit OR a required scanner was
# missing/errored; 2 = usage error; 3 = nothing to publish beyond the base;
# 4 = boot smoke-check failed; 5 = --base-ref does not resolve to a bootable
# template tree.

# betterleaks.toml) over the STAGING dir. It runs TWO scanners --
# betterleaks, kingfisher (--no-validate) -- and exits non-zero on a finding
# from EITHER of them, on any scanner error, or on any missing scanner binary
# (no fallback: the binaries are baked into the workspace image, so a missing
# one is a broken environment, never a reason to scan less). A hit
# prints the offending path (value redacted, never printed) and this script
# exits 1, so the worker reports `stuck` and NOTHING is committed or pushed.
# This is the enforced gate on top of the .gitignore denylist -- not LLM
# prose.
#
# Scanning the STAGE (not the assembled tree) means the scan covers exactly
# the content overlaid out of the live mind: the selected --include /
# --data-include paths plus any carried-forward inspiration-*.md/.svg. The
# clean base is the trusted, public default workspace template -- it cannot
# contain the user's secrets, and its own test fixtures legitimately hold
# placeholder token strings (e.g. "sk-ant-test"), so scanning it would only
# produce false positives that block every publish. The real risk is a secret
# riding in from the live mind's overlaid paths, and that is exactly what the
# stage holds. It also keeps the scan cheap regardless of how large the base
# is (never traverses vendor/, the base's fixtures, etc.). rsync -aR staged
# every file at its repo-relative path, so scan_secrets.sh's
# relative-to-scanned-dir finding paths ARE repo-root-relative.

# ${TITLE}

This file is the manifest for the **${TITLE}** inspiration (slug:
\`${SLUG}\`). It is the one document a future agent reads to understand,
present, and adapt this inspiration. If you are an agent in a mind that was
created from this inspiration, this file is your script: read all of it, then
follow "How to adapt it" below.

## What it is

${manifest_description}

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with a one-paragraph overview of what this inspiration does for its user: the
problem it solves, the main things it produces (pages, reports, automations),
and what the user sees when it is running. Write for a reader who has never
seen the original mind. -->

## How it works

The snapshot includes these paths (each is a repo-root-relative path copied
from the original mind onto a clean default-workspace-template base):

${included_paths_block}
<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with prose that makes the list above self-explanatory: for each included path,
say what it is (an app or lib with code, a skill, data) and what role it plays.
Then describe how the pieces wire together at runtime: which supervisord
programs (in system/supervisord.conf) run them, which ports they listen on and how
those are registered in forward_port.py (if applicable), and any scripts or
services that connect them. -->

## Recipe

This inspiration is version \`${INSPIRATION_VERSION}\` (front-matter \`version:\`).
It is not a fork of the workspace it came from -- it is DERIVED from it by the
recipe below: include these paths, leave these out, apply these
published-version rules. An update re-runs the recipe against the current
workspace and publishes the result as the next version, so anything excluded
here stays excluded even though it still exists in the source workspace. This
block is the durable home of that recipe -- a later update reads it back from
here.

\`\`\`yaml
version: ${INSPIRATION_VERSION}
${recipe_include_block}exclude:
<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): replace this line with one \`  - <path or feature>\`
entry per deliberate exclusion (paths not included, and features stripped out of
an included path), or with the single line \`  []\` if nothing was excluded. -->
modification_rules:
<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): replace this line with one \`  - <rule>\` entry per
published-version modification, stated as a RULE and never the removed value
(e.g. \`  - replace the hardcoded team Slack channel with a neutral default\`),
or with the single line \`  []\` if there were none. -->
\`\`\`

## Prerequisites

Activation requirements: what the adopting agent must SET UP -- and must
INITIATE ITSELF during setup, before asking how to adapt -- for this
inspiration to run against the new user's own accounts/data. One line per
requirement, in this machine-readable form (greppable by \`requires_\`):

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with one line per requirement, using exactly these forms:

- requires_permission: <latchkey scope> / <permission schema> (user-approved;
  the adopting agent initiates this via a latchkey permission request during
  setup -- it must not merely mention it)
- requires_secret: <ENV_VAR or config key> (what it is for and where to put it)
- requires_llm: <how the code reaches Claude, and what an adopter needs>
  (include this line whenever the app calls an LLM: name the method it was
  built for -- keyed litellm via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or keyless subscription via
  claude -p -- so an adopter on the other method knows to switch it per the
  use-ai-integration skill)

Derive the real values from the included code (e.g. every service the app
calls through \`latchkey curl\`, and whether any code calls an LLM). Example:
- requires_permission: slack-api / slack-read-all (user-approved; adopting
  agent initiates during setup)
- requires_llm: calls Claude via the keyed litellm path (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set);
  an adopter on the keyless subscription path must switch the model calls per
  use-ai-integration
If nothing is required, write exactly: "No prerequisites -- runs with no
external permissions or secrets." -->

## How to adapt it

Instructions for the NEXT agent -- the one adapting this inspiration into a
new mind. This is the \`use-inspiration\` skill's template path; in short:

1. Read this entire file first, especially "Prerequisites" and "Holes"
   below -- Prerequisites are your SETUP agenda, Holes are your ADAPTATION
   agenda.
2. Present the inspiration to the user in plain, non-technical language: what
   it is, what it does, and what it needs from them (name the Prerequisites).
3. Ask whether they want to use the same connectors (e.g. their own Slack).
   If YES: ACTIVATE FIRST -- initiate every \`requires_permission\` line NOW
   via a latchkey permission request (see the \`latchkey\` skill; the request
   opens the approval/login flow in the minds app), wire up any
   \`requires_secret\` values, start the services, and get the app showing
   THE USER'S OWN DATA. Done for a data-backed app means the user can open it
   and see their own data -- NOT that a service starts or an endpoint returns
   200. Then tell them it is live and to take a look.
4. Only AFTER that (or immediately, if they chose different connectors -- the
   swap is then the first adaptation) ask: "How do you want to adapt it?"
5. Work through each hole interactively, one at a time. Translate each into
   plain language, ask for a decision only when you genuinely need one, and
   resolve the obvious ones yourself.
6. When done, append a dated entry to "Adaptation history" below (never
   rewrite earlier entries) and commit.

## Holes

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with one bullet per hole: every ADAPTATION gap the adapter must decide or
rewire -- stubbed integrations, hardcoded accounts/channels/ids, data that was
not included, anything that will not work out of the box. For each, say what
is missing and what a working replacement looks like. Do NOT list activation
requirements here (permissions, tokens, accounts) -- those belong in
"Prerequisites" above. If there are genuinely no holes, say so explicitly. -->

## Publication history

This inspiration's changelog: what each published version changed. The PUBLISHER
appends one entry per version (newest last); earlier entries are never rewritten.
This is distinct from "Adaptation history" below, which is the ADOPTERS' log.

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment with
the first entry, in the form:
### v1 (YYYY-MM-DD) -- <one line: what this first version publishes>
using today's date. A later update of this inspiration (the update-published-inspiration
flow) appends "### v2 (date) -- what changed since v1", and so on. -->

## Adaptation history

Each mind that adapts this inspiration appends one dated entry below. Earlier
entries are never rewritten.

# Welcome the user (inspiration: ${TITLE})

This mind was created from an inspiration -- a published snapshot of apps
another mind built:

- Title: ${TITLE}
- Slug: \`${SLUG}\`
- Description: ${manifest_description}
- Manifest: \`inspiration-${SLUG}.md\` (at the repo root)

Do ALL of the following in your FIRST response, in the same turn, without
waiting to be asked:

1. Open with a short CUSTOM welcome that names **${TITLE}** and gives the
   one-line description above. Do NOT use a generic "Welcome to Minds"
   greeting and do NOT offer a generic suggestions list.
2. Immediately read \`inspiration-${SLUG}.md\` at the repo root (reading the
   manifest in the first turn is required).
3. In plain, non-technical language, present what the inspiration is and
   what it needs from the user -- name the manifest's "Prerequisites" (the
   connectors/permissions it runs on). Then ask whether they want to hook it
   up to their own accounts now (e.g. "Want me to connect this to your own
   Slack?"). End your first response on THAT question. This is the
   \`use-inspiration\` skill's template path; the manifest's "How to adapt
   it" section is the full script: if they say yes, ACTIVATE FIRST -- initiate
   each \`requires_permission\` via a latchkey permission request, get the
   app showing THEIR OWN DATA (that is the definition of working; a running
   service is not), invite them to take a look -- and only then ask how they
   want to adapt it.

If this repo has accumulated several \`inspiration-*.md\` manifests, the one
named above is the latest; treat the others as reference (they were likely
already adapted upstream).

It is NOT the generic workspace template -- it is this specific project.

## Use it

- **Create a new mind from it:** point a new minds workspace at this repo's
  URL. On first boot the mind reads the inspiration and helps you connect your
  own accounts and adapt it.
- **Bring it into an existing mind:** run \`/use-inspiration <this repo's URL>\`.

## What's inside

${inspirations_list}
Each \`inspiration-<slug>.md\` is the full manifest for that inspiration: what
it is, how it works, the prerequisites it needs, and how to adapt it.

# --- 8.6 remove the version history so it never ships in an inspiration ------

# docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md is WORKSPACE-only, never part of an inspiration: it records
# where a mind came from and every inspiration it has published (slugs, repo
# URLs, source commits). None of that belongs in a published inspiration -- and
# after an update-self, BASE_REF's tree can carry an accumulated copy of it --
# so drop it from the snapshot entirely. A mind created from this inspiration
# grows its OWN ledger when it first runs update-self or publishes (update-self
# and publish-inspiration write the starter on demand if the file is absent), so
# nothing is lost by omitting it here. `rm -f` is safe whether or not the base
# tree carried the file. This runs AFTER the no-diff guard so it can never make
# an empty include set look like it had something to publish.
rm -f docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md

# --- 9. boot smoke-check WITHOUT side effects, then single commit -------------

# Validate system/supervisord.conf via the supervisor python lib -- realize() +
# process_config() parse and check the config WITHOUT starting the daemon.
# NEVER `supervisord -t`: in supervisord, -t means --strip_ansi and LAUNCHES the
# daemon. If the lib is unavailable, skip the check (config holes in selected
# apps are acceptable; the base booting is what matters).
#
# Run the check with the interpreter that already ships the supervisor lib --
# the one behind the installed `supervisord` binary's shebang (system python) --
# NOT `uv run`. `uv run` would resolve and BUILD the whole project environment
# (workspace sources, native wheels like line-profiler) just to import one lib:
# many seconds on a cold clean base, and it can fail outright on an unrelated
# build error, spuriously aborting a publish that is otherwise fine. Deriving
# the interpreter from the supervisord shebang keeps the check ~0.1s and robust.

# --- 10. single commit, parented on BASE_REF (never on the mind's HEAD) ------

# The snapshot commit's parent is BASE_REF, NOT the branch's previous HEAD.
# This is a privacy invariant: the published repo's history must be the public
# template's history plus the snapshot commits -- never the mind's own commit
# history. Parenting on HEAD would ship every commit the mind ever made
# (including any secret that was ever committed and later removed: history
# keeps it retrievable), and would defeat published-version modifications
# ("publish a secret-cleaned copy of this file") entirely. commit-tree writes
# the already-validated assembled tree with the base as parent; reset --soft
# moves the branch there without touching the worktree or index.
