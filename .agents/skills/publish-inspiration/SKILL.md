# Publish an inspiration

Version: v1 (inspirations flow). This versions the publish/adopt flow and the
`inspiration-<slug>.md` manifest format.

An "inspiration" is a clean, shareable, **bootable** snapshot of something this
mind built -- an app or feature, but equally a chat customization or behavior, a
skill, a workflow, a service, config, or seed data: anything committable that
lives in the repo tree and can be snapshotted -- published to a new GitHub repo
so another mind can be created FROM it (not just read its source). One repo can
accumulate several inspirations (one manifest + thumbnail per inspiration, all at
the repo root). This skill delegates the assembly to a `launch-task` sub-agent
worker (which builds the snapshot, finishes the manifest, and designs the
thumbnail in its own git worktree), confirms the publish with the user in
chat, obtains GitHub access via latchkey permissioning (never the `gh` CLI),
and then creates the repo and pushes -- directly from the worker's worktree.

> **CWD INVARIANT -- read this before running anything in §§6-8.** From the
> moment §3's worker reports `done`, the live mind's checkout at `/home/user/workspace` is
> DONE being touched for the rest of this skill. Every command in §6 (chat
> confirmation and any confirmed manifest/thumbnail edits), §7 (GitHub auth),
> and §8 (create repo + push) runs with **cwd = `$WT`** (the worker's
> worktree), NEVER `/home/user/workspace`. There is no merge-back step: `$WT`'s tree, built
> by `build_inspiration.sh` on top of `BASE_REF` and finished by the worker,
> IS the tree that gets pushed, as-is, by you, from `$WT`. In particular,
> IGNORE `lead-proxy.md`'s default `done -> merge the worker's branch`
> handling for this flow -- `/home/user/workspace`'s branch and working tree are never
> modified, merged into, or pushed from. This is the single most important

> Do not reintroduce a merge, a `git checkout mngr/<slug>` in `/home/user/workspace`, or any
> other step that runs from `/home/user/workspace` after assembly.
>
> **The ONE sanctioned exception: §8 step 4, the version-history entry.** After
> the push has SUCCEEDED, `/home/user/workspace` gets exactly one write -- appending this
> publish to `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` and committing that single file on the branch
> `/home/user/workspace` is already on. That is a normal one-file commit, not a tree
> operation: `git add docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` + `git commit`, and NEVER a merge, a
> checkout, a reset, a `git add -A`, or anything that touches another path. It
> is what makes a publish knowable afterwards (slug, repo, version, and the
> source commit the snapshot was cut from). Do not mistake it for the
> tree-clobbering pattern above, and do not generalize it: nothing else in
> §§6-10 runs from `/home/user/workspace`, and if the push fails it does not run at all.

## Shared conventions

- **Slug derivation.** `slug` = the user's title lowercased, with each run of
  characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` collapsed to a single `-`, and leading /
  trailing `-` stripped. The result MUST match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` and MUST NOT
  start with `-` (`build_inspiration.sh` re-validates). `repo_name` defaults to
  `slug`; the user may override it in the chat confirmation (§6) -- validate
  any override against the same pattern yourself. The same slug names the
  manifest (`inspiration-<slug>.md`), the thumbnail (`inspiration-<slug>.svg`),
  the assembly worker, and the worker's branch (`mngr/<slug>`).
- **`$WT` -- the worker's worktree.** `mngr create` places worker worktrees
  under `/home/user/worktrees/<name>-<uuid>/` (the `worktree_base_folder` in
  `.mngr/settings.toml`; the `<uuid>` suffix is random), so the path cannot be
  guessed -- resolve it after the worker's `done` report per §3. Everything
  after assembly runs with cwd = `$WT` (see the callout above).
- **`BASE_REF` (provenance + clean base).** The workspace's template base
  -- the template state this mind started from (or last updated itself to).
  Resolve it **in-repo, with no network access** (see step 2); do NOT
  `git fetch`/`git pull` upstream. Pass it to `build_inspiration.sh` as
  `--base-ref`.

## 1. Setup Q&A and the scope gate (live in chat)

Ask the user, in plain language. Never enumerate files at them:

- what they want to include -- an app or feature, but equally a skill, a chat
  customization or behavior, a workflow, a service, config, or seed data:
  anything committable that lives in the repo tree. You translate this into a set
  of repo-root-relative include paths (e.g. `system/apps/slack_inbox`
  plus their service wiring, or `.agents/skills/<name>` for a skill) -- you reason
  about the backing paths, the user does not;
- what data should be included -- and this is NOT an all-or-nothing default.
  Judge each candidate data path by whether it is **personal**: information
  about the user or specific real people (names, emails, accounts, messages,
  contacts, private notes -- anything identifying, or that they'd reasonably
  consider theirs). **Personal data is kept private by default -- excluded from
  the snapshot.** **Non-personal data -- generic seed/sample/reference data,
  fixtures, config defaults, and public or synthetic datasets with no tie to a
  real person -- is included by default**, since shipping it is what makes the
  inspiration bootable and genuinely useful to an adopter. For anything
  **remotely close to the boundary** -- arguably personal, a mix of personal
  and non-personal, or simply data you are not sure how to classify -- do NOT
  silently pick a side: ask the user what they want and let their answer
  decide. When in doubt, treat it as near-the-boundary and ask rather than
  guessing;
- whether anything should be **changed, removed, or generalized in the
  published version only** -- hardcoded personal preferences, account or
  channel names, anything they'd rather not ship. Their live files stay
  untouched; the edits land only in the snapshot (see the modifications step
  in §3);
- a name for the inspiration (propose one yourself; it becomes the title, and
  the slug derives from it -- naming is cheap to change later, so it never
  needs to hold up the gate below).

**If what they want to snapshot is not committed to git** -- an ephemeral chat
behavior, the current conversation's history, runtime-only state, anything that
lives only in memory or outside the repo tree -- it cannot go into an inspiration
as-is: an inspiration must be reconstructable from the committed tree, so a
snapshot that omits it would boot without the very thing that made it worth
sharing. Recognize this and, before going further, suggest turning it into
something committable first -- most often by crystallizing it into a skill (this
repo's `crystallize-creation` skill promotes just-finished work into a committed,
tested skill), or otherwise capturing it as config, seed data, or a service that
does live in the tree. Once it is committed, include it like any other path
above.

Derive `slug` and `repo_name` from the title. Resolve the concrete set of
include paths yourself.

**The scope gate: confirm BEFORE any assembly work -- before treating the
include set as final, and before dispatching the worker (§3). This is a hard
gate.** Send ONE message that lays out, in plain language:

- what WILL be included (apps/features, plus any non-personal data that ships
  with them -- not file lists);
- what will NOT be included that they might expect (their personal data, other
  apps this mind has, secrets/config) -- so surprises surface now;
- any data near the personal/non-personal boundary you flagged in the data
  question above, restated so they can settle it before assembly begins;
- the published-version modifications you will apply (or "none");
- the proposed title and repo name, marked as adjustable later;
- the default private visibility.

Then STOP your turn and WAIT for the user's reply. The go-ahead must be an
explicit answer to THIS message -- the user's original "publish this" request
is NOT it, however specific it was. Never announce anything as "confirmed"
that the user has not themselves replied to: confirmation is something the
user gives, not something you declare. (A real publish run declared "include
set confirmed" and dispatched the worker in the same turn as its own
proposal; this gate exists to prevent exactly that.)

**A rename NEVER requires tearing down or relaunching the worker.** The
worker's own name and its branch name are internal plumbing -- they appear
nowhere in the published repo (§8 mints a single snapshot commit from the
final tree and pushes that commit, never the branch), so a stale name there
is irrelevant. If the user renames after
dispatch anyway, handle it in place:

- Renamed before the worker has run the script: just pass the new
  `--slug`/`--title` to `build_inspiration.sh`.
- Renamed after the script has run (worker mid-run or done): rename in
  place -- `git mv` the manifest and thumbnail to the new slug names, update
  the front-matter `title:` and the generated welcome's slug references,
  commit (in the worker's worktree). This preserves any FILL-IN prose and
  bespoke SVG already done. Do NOT re-run the script under a new slug in an
  already-assembled worktree: its carry-forward step would keep the
  old-slug files as if they were an accumulated earlier inspiration. A
  display-title-only change is just the front-matter edit.

## 2. Resolve `BASE_REF` and `SOURCE_SHA` (in-repo, no network)

`BASE_REF` is this workspace's **template base** -- the template state the
mind started from (or last updated itself to). Resolve it deterministically as
the NEWEST first-parent commit that is a template-state marker:

```bash
BASE_REF=$(git log --first-parent --format='%H %s' HEAD \
    | awk '{h=$1; sub(/^[^ ]+ /,""); if ($0 ~ /^update-self:/ || $0 == "Initial workspace commit") {print h; exit}}')
```

Two marker kinds; the newest one on the first-parent chain wins:

- **`update-self: ...`** -- the mind pulled a newer template version after
  creation (the same subject convention `update-self` / `assist` rely on).
- **`Initial workspace commit`** -- written by bootstrap on the mind's very
  first boot (always present -- it is created `--allow-empty` by
  `system/libs/bootstrap` -- and it snapshots exactly what the workspace started
  from, including any uncommitted source state a dev-flow clone carried).
  This is the normal answer for a mind that never ran `update-self`.

This is NOT a judgment call -- do not go hunting for an older "clean template"
commit past the marker. A full-history clone's first-parent ancestry reaches
ancient template commits that have nothing to do with this mind; the marker is
the mind's actual base.

**Fallback (only if NO marker exists** -- a hand-made or pre-bootstrap repo):
the **first-parent root**:

```bash
git rev-list --first-parent HEAD | tail -1
```

The fallback MUST be the first-parent root, never a bare root-commit lookup
(`git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`): subtree merges add parallel root commits
that are NOT the seed (a mind repo can have several near-empty roots), while
the first-parent chain from HEAD always ends at the true template seed. Do NOT
fetch or pull from upstream to obtain `BASE_REF` in any case -- `system/config/parent.toml`
is a provenance link only.

**Mandatory pre-check (before ANY assembly).** Verify the resolved base is a
bootable template -- its tree must name both `pyproject.toml` and
`system/supervisord.conf`:

```bash
git ls-tree --name-only "<BASE_REF>^{tree}" | grep -qx pyproject.toml \
  && git ls-tree --name-only "<BASE_REF>^{tree}" | grep -qx system/supervisord.conf
```

If the check fails, STOP and reconsider the base (e.g. walk forward along the
first-parent chain to the earliest commit that passes both checks, or ask
the user) rather than launching the worker -- this catches the wrong-root and
too-old-base problems in seconds instead of a full worker round-trip.
`build_inspiration.sh` re-validates both conditions itself and exits 5 with
a clear message (see §5), but that is a backstop, not a substitute for the
pre-check.

(The same marker walk seeds the version ledger's `## Workspace` origin line in
§8 step 4 below (and in `update-self` §5b) -- with one deliberate difference: the
origin-line walk takes the OLDEST marker (where the mind started) where this
section takes the NEWEST (the base the mind is on now). This `BASE_REF` bash is
the primary; keep the two in step if either ever changes.)

**Also capture `SOURCE_SHA` -- the source commit the snapshot is cut from.**
The worker's worktree branches off `/home/user/workspace`'s current `HEAD`, so that commit is
the provenance anchor recorded in §8 step 4's version-history entry (and what a
later reader diffs against to see what changed since). Capture it now, in
`/home/user/workspace`, BEFORE dispatching -- not after the push, when `/home/user/workspace`'s `HEAD` may
have moved on:

```bash
SOURCE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

## 3. Delegate assembly to a launch-task worker

Do NOT dispatch until the user has explicitly replied to §1's scope-gate
message confirming what goes in, what stays out, and the published-version
modifications. If a rename arrives after dispatch anyway, fix it in place per §1 --
never tear down or relaunch the worker for a rename (its name and branch are
internal and appear nowhere in the published repo).

Assembly runs in a `launch-task` sub-agent worker. The worker gets a fresh git
worktree on branch `mngr/<slug>`, runs `build_inspiration.sh` there, then --
in the SAME run, no second round-trip -- fleshes out every manifest FILL-IN
block and designs the bespoke thumbnail. `/home/user/workspace` is never modified.

The worker name is `<slug>`. Names must be unique: if a previous attempt left
a worker or branch with this name, clean it up first
(`uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py destroy --name <slug>`,
then `git branch -D "mngr/<slug>"` once no worktree holds it).

Per `launch-task`, the whole delegation is ONE step in your timeline:

```bash
tk create --step "Delegate assembling the shareable inspiration snapshot to a sub-agent"
# -> Created cod-step-XXXX: ...
tk start cod-step-XXXX
```

**Write the task file.** Substitute the real `<slug>`, `<title>`,
`<description>`, `<BASE_REF>`, the include paths, and the user-confirmed
published-version modifications list (from §1's scope gate; write "None
requested." if there are none) into the body -- the worker must be able to
run the script verbatim, with zero back-and-forth:

````bash
mkdir -p data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>
{
cat << FRONTMATTER_EOF
---
lead_agent: $MNGR_AGENT_NAME
finish_report_path: data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/reports/report.md
---
FRONTMATTER_EOF
cat << 'BODY_EOF'

# Task: Assemble the "<title>" inspiration snapshot

## What to do

Assemble a clean, bootable "inspiration" snapshot on your worktree's branch,
then finish its manifest and thumbnail. Do ALL of it in this one run.

**Before anything else**, extract `LEAD_AGENT` / `FINISH_REPORT_PATH` per
`.agents/shared/references/worker-reporting.md`: step 1's script resets your
worktree to a clean template base and deletes gitignored state -- including
`data/` and this task file -- so parse the frontmatter FIRST.

1. **Run the assembly script** from your worktree root, verbatim (every value
   below was already resolved by the lead):

   ```bash
   bash .agents/skills/publish-inspiration/scripts/build_inspiration.sh \
       --base-ref <BASE_REF> \
       --slug <slug> \
       --title "<title>" \
       --description "<description>" \
       --include <path> [--include <path> ...] \
       [--data-include <path> ...]
   ```

   On ANY non-zero exit: nothing was committed; go straight to "Reporting
   back" with a `stuck` report that quotes the script's stderr verbatim (the
   exit code maps to a specific guard rail the lead knows how to handle). Do
   NOT retry with different arguments and do NOT assemble anything by hand.

2. **Apply the published-version modifications** (skip if the list below
   says none). These are user-confirmed edits that belong ONLY in the
   published snapshot -- the live mind keeps its own versions, and nothing
   you do here touches it:

   <one line per modification: file + the change to make, e.g.
   "system/apps/slack_zen_garden/config.py: replace the hardcoded '#team-garden'
   channel with a neutral default the adopter sets" -- or the single line
   "None requested.">

   After applying them, re-run the secret scan over every file you modified,
   with the same shared script the assembly's scan gate uses. It runs both
   scanners (betterleaks, kingfisher) and exits non-zero on any finding, any
   scanner error, or any missing scanner -- there is no fallback scanner:

   ```bash
   bash .agents/skills/publish-inspiration/scripts/scan_secrets.sh <each modified file>
   ```

   A finding means a modification did not fully remove a credential -- fix
   it or report `stuck`; never leave it in. If the script reports a missing
   scanner, or the script itself is absent from your assembled tree (a
   BASE_REF that predates it), report `stuck` -- do not substitute a weaker
   ad-hoc scan.

3. **Flesh out the manifest.** `inspiration-<slug>.md` at the repo root has
   `<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): ... -->` comment blocks in "What it is,"
   "How it works," "Recipe," "Prerequisites," "Holes," and "Publication
   history" -- generated placeholders, not real content. Replace EVERY block
   with real, specific content. "Publication history" is this inspiration's
   changelog: replace its FILL-IN with the first entry `### v1 (YYYY-MM-DD) --
   <one line: what this first version publishes>` using today's date; later
   updates append `### v2 (date) -- what changed`. It is the PUBLISHER's log --
   never write into "Adaptation history", which is the adopters' log.
   "Prerequisites" is the strictest: one machine-readable line per activation
   requirement in the exact `requires_permission:` / `requires_secret:` forms
   the template shows, derived from the included code (inspect every service
   the app reaches through `latchkey curl` and name the real latchkey scope
   and permission schema, e.g. `slack-api / slack-read-all`). These lines are
   what the ADOPTING agent acts on during setup -- it initiates each one via
   a latchkey permission request before asking how to adapt -- so a vague or
   missing line silently breaks adoption (a real incident: an adopter never
   prompted for a Slack permission the app needed). This list IS "what the
   inspiration's user would need to give for the app to work"; it must be
   complete and accurate, because the lead surfaces it back to the publishing
   user for confirmation in §6 and a gap you leave here is exactly what that
   confirmation is checking for. "Holes" is the
   adaptation agenda only -- design gaps, stubbed integrations, hardcoded
   accounts -- never activation requirements. If a section genuinely has
   nothing to add, say so explicitly in prose; never leave a placeholder
   comment in place and never leave a section blank.

   **LLM access is a first-class prerequisite.** If any included code calls an
   LLM (Claude) -- an AI-driven service, an AI integration, a scripted model
   step -- record that dependency explicitly, because HOW a mind reaches Claude
   is per-environment and differs between the publisher and the adopter. This
   repo's `use-ai-integration` skill routes through a KEYED path
   (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set -> `litellm`, pay-per-token API) or a KEYLESS path
   (`claude -p` -> the subscription credit pool), chosen by whether
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present. The adopter's mind may use the OTHER method
   than the one this code was written against. So add a Prerequisites line naming
   the LLM dependency and the method it was built for, e.g. `requires_llm: calls
   Claude via the keyed litellm path (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY); an adopter on the
   keyless subscription path must switch the model calls per use-ai-integration`.
   If the code hardcodes one path (a key, an endpoint, a specific model), ALSO
   list switching it to the adopter's method as a Hole. Never leave an LLM
   dependency implicit: the adopter must know the app needs LLM access and be
   able to wire in their own method (subscription or litellm).

   **"Recipe" is the machine-readable one.** An inspiration is not a fork of the
   workspace -- it is DERIVED from it by a recipe, and an update re-runs that
   recipe rather than diffing two repos, so the recipe (not the diff) is what
   must survive in the published repo. Its `yaml` block already carries the
   inspiration's version (`v1`) and the include paths; you fill the two
   remaining keys, terse, one list entry per line:

   - `exclude:` -- every deliberate exclusion: paths NOT included that a reader
     might expect, and features stripped out of an included path. This is what
     keeps an exclusion excluded when a later update re-runs the recipe against
     a source workspace that still has the thing.
   - `modification_rules:` -- one entry per published-version modification from
     step 2, written as a RULE and NEVER as the removed value (`- replace the
     hardcoded team Slack channel with a neutral default`, never the channel
     name itself). The whole point of a modification is that the value does not
     ship; restating it here would publish it.

   Use `  []` for either key if there is genuinely nothing.

   The generated `README.md` at the repo root (the repo's GitHub landing
   page) carries ONE `<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): ... -->` block too --
   a short overview of this inspiration. Replace it with a GitHub-flavored
   version of the manifest's "What it is" (2-4 sentences). The rest of the
   README is generated correctly and describes this inspiration, not the
   template -- do not revert it to the default-workspace-template README.

4. **Design the thumbnail.** `inspiration-<slug>.svg` at the repo root is a
   generic placeholder the script generated -- it must never be published.
   Replace its entire contents with a bespoke SVG you design for THIS app: a
   clean, simple, iconic representation of what the app actually is and shows
   (derive it from the app code and the manifest you just wrote -- e.g. a
   stylized miniature of its main screen or its core object). Hard rules:
   mock data only, never real user data; no `<script>`; no `on*=` event
   attributes; no `<foreignObject>`; no external references (no href/src
   pointing outside the file) -- fully self-contained. Keep the root
   `viewBox` around 240x160.

5. **Commit** the modification + manifest + thumbnail edits as a follow-up
   commit on your branch (`mngr/<slug>`), in your worktree.

6. **Self-check, then report.** Both greps must print NOTHING before you may
   report `done`:

   ```bash
   grep -n -- '<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent)' inspiration-<slug>.md README.md
   grep -nEi -- 'minds-placeholder-thumbnail|<script|<foreignObject|on[a-z]+[[:space:]]*=' inspiration-<slug>.svg
   ```

   If either prints anything, fix and re-commit; do not report done until
   both are clean and `git status` is clean.

## Context

- Your worktree is a fresh checkout on branch `mngr/<slug>`. The script
  resets it to the clean template base `<BASE_REF>` and overlays only the
  selected paths, so the final tree looks nothing like the live mind's HEAD
  -- that is correct and expected. Do not "restore" anything it removes.
- Included paths and what each one is:
  <one line per include path: what it is and its role>
- <extra context the lead has: what the app does for its user, known holes,
  tokens/accounts it depends on -- everything the worker needs to write a
  good manifest and a representative thumbnail>

## Success criteria

- `build_inspiration.sh` exited 0 and its commit is on `mngr/<slug>`.
- Every published-version modification applied, its files re-scanned clean.
- Every FILL-IN block replaced with real prose (or an explicit "none") -- in
  BOTH `inspiration-<slug>.md` and `README.md`.
- `README.md` describes this inspiration (not the default-workspace-template).
- `inspiration-<slug>.svg` is a bespoke design for this app; the placeholder
  marker is gone and the safety grep is clean.
- Follow-up edits committed on `mngr/<slug>`; `git status` clean.

## Reporting back

Follow `.agents/shared/references/worker-reporting.md` for the full report
procedure. Substitutions for this task:

- `<TASK_FILE_GLOB>` -> `data/.tasks/launch-task/*/task.md`
- `<RUNTIME_REPORTS_DIR>` -> `data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/reports/` (recreate
  it with `mkdir -p` -- the assembly script deleted `data/`)
- Valid `name:` values: `question` (mid-flight gate), `done` / `stuck`
  (terminal).

In a `done` report body, include your worktree's absolute path (from
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) and the branch `mngr/<slug>` -- the lead
publishes directly from that worktree. In a `stuck` report, quote the
assembly script's stderr verbatim.
BODY_EOF
} > data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/task.md
````

**Launch** (foreground, so a failed launch surfaces immediately):

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py launch \
    --name <slug> \
    --template worker \
    --runtime-dir data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/ \
    --task-file data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/task.md
```

**Background-await the report** (Bash `run_in_background: true` -- never block
on it), then continue with whatever else you were doing:

```bash
# Run with Bash run_in_background: true
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py await \
    --name <slug> \
    --task-file data/.tasks/launch-task/<slug>/task.md
```

**Handle the report** per `.agents/shared/references/lead-proxy.md` (proxy or
answer any `question` gate, consume reports into `consumed/`, diagnose
liveness on a timeout) -- with one critical override:

- `name: stuck` -> the assembly script refused for one of §5's reasons.
  Surface the quoted stderr to the user plainly and stop (or fix the input --
  e.g. re-resolve `BASE_REF` per §2 -- and relaunch). Do not publish anything.
- `name: done` -> do **NOT** merge `mngr/<slug>` (that is `lead-proxy.md`'s
  default `done` handling, and it is exactly the merge the CWD-INVARIANT
  callout forbids -- the assembled tree diffs against `/home/user/workspace` as mass
  deletions). Instead, resolve `$WT`:

  ```bash
  WT="$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk -v b='refs/heads/mngr/<slug>' '$1 == "worktree" { wt = $2 } $1 == "branch" && $2 == b { print wt }')"
  ```

  Cross-check it against the worktree path in the report body (worktrees live
  under `/home/user/worktrees/<slug>-<uuid>/`), then verify the worker's gates
  yourself -- both greps must print nothing and `git -C "$WT" status` must be
  clean:

  ```bash
  grep -n -- '<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent)' "$WT/inspiration-<slug>.md" "$WT/README.md"
  grep -nEi -- 'minds-placeholder-thumbnail|<script|<foreignObject|on[a-z]+[[:space:]]*=' "$WT/inspiration-<slug>.svg"
  ```

  If either grep hits, message the worker to finish the job (per
  `lead-proxy.md`'s gate mechanics) rather than finishing it yourself.
  Once clean, close the delegation step and proceed to §6 (chat
  confirmation), §7 (GitHub auth), and §8 (create repo + push), ALL running
  with **cwd = `$WT`** (see the callout above).

Leave the worker itself alone until §10 -- destroying it removes `$WT`, which
you still need for the push.

## 4. What the assembly does

`build_inspiration.sh` (documented below) does the whole mechanical assembly
in the worker's worktree: clean base + overlay + secret scan + manifest +
placeholder thumbnail + an inspiration-specific `/welcome` written into the
snapshot + boot smoke-check + a single
commit. It communicates purely via its exit code -- `0` on success (the
assembled commit is on `mngr/<slug>`), non-zero otherwise (see §5). It prints
a summary of what it assembled to stderr. The worker then supplies the two
things the script cannot: the manifest prose and the bespoke thumbnail.

## 5. Guard rails (the script's non-zero exits)

The worker maps any non-zero exit to a `stuck` report quoting the script's
stderr. What each exit means, and what you do:

- **Secret scan (exit 1).** A credential/token rode in on an overlaid path,
  OR one of the two required scanners (betterleaks / kingfisher) was missing
  or errored -- the stderr says which. Nothing was committed; for a finding,
  surface the flagged path (value redacted) and stop. For a missing/broken
  scanner, the environment is broken (the binaries are baked into the
  workspace image; if one is missing, the stderr names the command to
  reinstall both) -- never publish around the gate.
- **No-diff guard (exit 3).** The resolved include set contributes nothing
  beyond `BASE_REF` (the assembled tree equals the base tree). Tell the user
  plainly and do NOT create a repo -- there are no empty inspiration repos.
- **Boot smoke-check (exit 4).** The clean base does not boot at all; abort
  BEFORE any repo creation. Selected apps having holes is expected and does NOT
  fail the check.
- **Non-template base (exit 5).** The `--base-ref` does not resolve to a tree
  in the repo, or its tree is not a bootable template: it lacks
  `pyproject.toml` and/or `system/supervisord.conf` (e.g. a parallel subtree root was
  picked instead of the real seed). Nothing was committed; re-resolve
  `BASE_REF` per
  §2 (its pre-check should have caught this before launch) and relaunch.

Every one of these is a "fix the input and relaunch the worker" situation,
never a "publish something smaller instead" situation -- see the "MUST BE
BOOTABLE" callout at the top of this skill.

## 6. Confirm the publish in chat

**cwd = `$WT` for this and every remaining section.** The manifest/thumbnail
files referenced below (`inspiration-<slug>.md` / `.svg`) live at `$WT`'s repo
root, not `/home/user/workspace`'s.

Confirmation happens inline in chat -- there is no other confirmation
mechanism. Present the proposal to the user ONCE, in plain language:

- the **title** and **description**;
- the **repo name** (defaults to `slug`);
- the **visibility** (default: **private**);
- a short recap of the **published-version modifications** that were applied
  (or that there were none), so the user can verify their requested removals
  and changes actually happened;
- the **permissions and secrets an adopter must grant** -- the set the
  manifest's "Prerequisites" lists (the worker derived these from the code in
  §3), stated plainly rather than as `requires_` lines, e.g. "For this to work,
  whoever adopts it will need to connect/grant: <X>, <Y>. Do those look right and
  complete?". This is "what the inspiration's user would need to give for the app
  to work", and the publisher's reply is part of the go-ahead: if they say a
  permission or secret is missing or wrong, fix the manifest's "Prerequisites" in
  `$WT` (and re-commit per the commit step below) BEFORE proceeding to §7/§8 -- a
  missing or inaccurate line silently breaks adoption, since it is exactly what
  the adopting agent initiates during setup. If Prerequisites says there are
  none, state that too, so the user can confirm the app really needs nothing;
- the **thumbnail** the sub-agent designed -- EMBED it in the chat message
  as a markdown image so the user actually sees what will represent their
  inspiration, using the file's absolute path:

  ```markdown
  ![<title> thumbnail]($WT/inspiration-<slug>.svg)
  ```

  (substitute the real absolute worktree path), and note you can adjust it if
  they'd like.

Then END YOUR TURN and WAIT. **This is a hard gate, exactly like §1's:** §8
(create the repo + push) may only run after an explicit go-ahead in the
user's reply TO THIS MESSAGE. No earlier approval counts -- not the §1 scope
confirmation, not a "go ahead and publish" given before assembly, not
approving the GitHub permission requests in the minds app. The final title,
description, and thumbnail only came into existence during assembly, so the
user cannot have approved them yet. Your own gate checks (the FILL-IN /
placeholder / safety greps, generalization spot-checks) are VERIFICATION,
not confirmation -- they never substitute for the user's reply. (A real
publish run verified everything itself, announced "everything checks out,"
and pushed in the same turn -- the user never saw the thumbnail or final
details before the repo existed on their account. This gate exists to
prevent exactly that.)

Take edits in their replies and apply them; once their reply is an explicit
go-ahead, proceed with the agreed values. Do not re-ask what they already
answered in §1; this is a confirm-and-adjust pass, not a second interview.
If the user asks to abort, stop here and leave the assembled commit intact
(§10's failure path).

- Validate an edited repo name against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` (no leading `-`)
  before using it.
- If the user asks for thumbnail changes, YOU edit
  `$WT/inspiration-<slug>.svg`, keeping the same safety rules the worker
  followed: mock data only, no `<script>`, no `on*=` attributes, no
  `<foreignObject>`, no external references. If the user pastes raw SVG
  markup in chat, never write it into the file verbatim -- apply the same
  rules first (strip anything that violates them, and tell the user what you
  stripped).

**Commit before §8's push.** Write any confirmed title/description edits into
`inspiration-<slug>.md`'s front-matter (any Prerequisites the publisher flagged
as missing or wrong into its "Prerequisites" section, and any thumbnail edits
into the `.svg`), and COMMIT that change with cwd = `$WT` before proceeding to
§7/§8.
Never push first and fix up the manifest or thumbnail with a second
commit-and-re-push. This commit -- like everything else in this skill after
assembly -- happens IN `$WT`, never `/home/user/workspace`.

## 7. Ensure GitHub access (latchkey -- do NOT use the gh CLI)

GitHub access goes through **latchkey's github permissioning**, exactly like
every other connector in this template (see the `latchkey` skill). Do NOT use
the `gh` CLI anywhere in this flow -- no `gh auth`, no `gh repo` -- and do not
run browser/device login flows. Latchkey keeps the credential outside the
container and injects it per-request; the user approves once in the minds app.

The flow needs TWO github scopes, both approved once by the user in minds:

- `github-rest-api` (`github-read-user` + `github-write-all`) -- the API
  calls in §8: repo creation and the topic. The names matter: repo creation
  is `POST /user/repos`, whose path the narrower `github-write-repos`
  permission does NOT match (its schema covers `/repos/...` paths only), and
  the `/user` probe needs `github-read-user`. Requesting narrower names
  produces a grant that 403s the flow's own calls even after the user
  approves.
- `github-git` (`github-git-write`) -- the `git push` itself. The gateway
  natively proxies GitHub's git smart-HTTP endpoints (a push is just a `GET
  info/refs?service=git-receive-pack` + a `POST git-receive-pack`), so the
  push goes through latchkey too; no token ever enters this container.

Probe both up front:

```bash
# API access. The -f matters: latchkey curl exits with curl's own code, and
# the gateway rejects unpermitted requests with an HTTP 403 (a completed
# exchange, so exit 0 without -f); -f turns a denial into exit 22:
latchkey curl -sf https://api.github.com/user
# Push access -- a github-git (or catch-all) rule granting github-git-write
# (or "any") must exist; grants can take either form, so check both:
latchkey curl http://latchkey-self.invalid/permissions/self \
    | jq -e '[.rules[]? | to_entries[] | select(.key == "github-git" or .key == "any") | select(any(.value[]?; . == "github-git-write" or . == "any"))] | length > 0' >/dev/null \
    && echo "git push: permitted" || echo "git push: NOT permitted"
```

For whichever is missing, initiate the permission request YOURSELF (each
request opens the approval/login flow in the minds app; the body must be
exactly the four fields shown -- `agent_id`, `type`, `payload`, `rationale`):

```bash
latchkey curl -XPOST http://latchkey-self.invalid/permission-requests \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"agent_id": "'"$MNGR_AGENT_ID"'", "type": "predefined", "payload": {"scope": "github-rest-api", "permissions": ["github-read-user", "github-write-all"]}, "rationale": "Publish this inspiration as a new GitHub repo on your account."}'
latchkey curl -XPOST http://latchkey-self.invalid/permission-requests \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"agent_id": "'"$MNGR_AGENT_ID"'", "type": "predefined", "payload": {"scope": "github-git", "permissions": ["github-git-write"]}, "rationale": "Push the published inspiration'"'"'s git history to the new repo."}'
```

Tell the user in chat that a GitHub approval is waiting for them in minds,
then poll the probes **as a background task, bounded** (mirror `launch-task`'s
background-await pattern; a foreground `while` loop can be killed by your own
tool-execution timeout):

```bash
# Run with Bash run_in_background: true -- bounded (~5 minutes), one wait, no re-arm thrash
for _ in $(seq 1 30); do
    if latchkey curl -sf https://api.github.com/user >/dev/null 2>&1 \
        && latchkey curl http://latchkey-self.invalid/permissions/self \
           | jq -e '[.rules[]? | to_entries[] | select(.key == "github-git" or .key == "any") | select(any(.value[]?; . == "github-git-write" or . == "any"))] | length > 0' >/dev/null; then
        echo "github access: permitted (api + git push)"
        exit 0
    fi
    sleep 10
done
echo "github access: still not permitted" >&2
exit 1
```

If the user never approves, surface a clear message and stop, leaving the
assembled commit intact. Do NOT fall back to any other credential or
mechanism (no token-in-URL pushes, no partial-tree API uploads -- see
the "MUST BE BOOTABLE" callout).

## 8. Create the repo and push

**cwd = `$WT`.** This is the step that actually publishes -- it MUST run from
the worker's worktree so the push sends `$WT`'s assembled branch (the clean
snapshot), never anything from `/home/user/workspace`.

With `repo_name` / `visibility` taken from the chat confirmation:

- **Pre-push checklist:**
  - `(cd "$WT" && git status)` must be clean -- the confirmed
    thumbnail/manifest edits from §6 are already committed in `$WT`, nothing
    uncommitted remains. If anything is dirty, commit it first (in `$WT`);
    never push and then fix up with a re-push.
  - **Placeholder-thumbnail gate** -- this grep must print NOTHING:

    ```bash
    grep -nEi -- 'minds-placeholder-thumbnail|<script|<foreignObject|on[a-z]+[[:space:]]*=' "$WT/inspiration-<slug>.svg"
    ```

    A `minds-placeholder-thumbnail` hit means the script's placeholder is
    still in place (the bespoke thumbnail never landed); the other patterns
    are the SVG safety rules. On ANY hit, block the push, fix the file (a
    real bespoke SVG, rules applied), commit in `$WT`, and re-run the gate.

Publish in TWO steps -- create the repo via the GitHub API through latchkey,
then push the assembled branch with git. (Historical note: this flow once used
`gh repo create --source=.`, which both violates the no-gh rule and breaks
inside git worktrees, whose `.git` is a file.)

**Step 1 -- create the repo (latchkey, sets name + description + visibility
in one call):**

```bash
latchkey curl -X POST https://api.github.com/user/repos \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name": "<repo_name>", "description": "<description> (minds inspiration v1)", "private": <true|false>}'
```

Take `<owner>` from the response's `.owner.login`. `"private"` is `true` for
the default private visibility, `false` only if the user chose public. The
repo description is always the confirmed `<description>` followed by the
literal suffix ` (minds inspiration v1)` -- the flow-version marker every
published repo carries; keep it verbatim. You
already validated `repo_name` against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` in §6; keep the
JSON built from variables, never string-interpolated shell.

**Step 1b -- lock down the collaboration surface (unconditional -- never ask
the user).** Immediately after the repo exists, close every surface where a
non-collaborator could open or inject content, so an inspiration can never
become a public forum on the author's account. Do it in ONE call to the "Update
a repository" endpoint (`PATCH /repos/<owner>/<repo>`), NOT the create call above
-- that is why this is a follow-up call. Set, unconditionally (public or
private):

- `"pull_request_creation_policy": "collaborators_only"` -- only users with write
  access can open a pull request; arbitrary outsiders cannot.
- `"has_issues": false`, `"has_wiki": false`, `"has_projects": false`,
  `"has_discussions": false` -- disable the issue tracker, wiki, projects, and
  discussions outright.

```bash
latchkey curl -X PATCH "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo_name>" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"pull_request_creation_policy": "collaborators_only", "has_issues": false, "has_wiki": false, "has_projects": false, "has_discussions": false}'
```

`<owner>` is the `.owner.login` you took from step 1's response; `<repo_name>`
is the name you already validated in §6. This PATCH is covered by the same
`github-write-all` grant from §7 (exactly like the topics `PUT` in step 3), so
no new permission scope is needed; keep the JSON built from variables, never
string-interpolated shell. If the call fails, treat it like the topics call:
retry once, and if it still fails, report it as a minor follow-up rather than
failing the whole publish -- the repo already exists and is private by default,
so the comment surface is still closed.

Two residual surfaces GitHub's REST API cannot fully close. On a PRIVATE
inspiration (the default) neither matters -- outsiders have no access at all --
so only surface them to the user if they chose PUBLIC visibility (inform them --
do NOT ask permission):

- **Pull requests can only be RESTRICTED to collaborators, not fully turned off,
  via the API** -- the "disable pull requests entirely" toggle is UI-only. The
  `collaborators_only` policy above already blocks arbitrary outsiders, which is
  what matters.
- **Forking cannot be disabled on a personal public repo** (GitHub allows
  `allow_forking: false` only on org-owned repos). Keeping the inspiration
  private is the only way to also prevent outside forks.

**Step 2 -- mint ONE snapshot commit and push it as `main` (git through the
latchkey gateway):**

**Commit structure (hard requirement) -- at least two commits.** The published
`main` must contain, at minimum:

1. **the template files exactly as they came** -- at least one commit, and
   preferably the template's whole real history (carried along by parenting on
   `BASE_REF`; see below). This is the pristine, already-public template base,
   never this mind's own accumulated history.
2. **exactly one** commit on top carrying ONLY this inspiration's changes -- the
   delta over `BASE_REF`, with all published-version cleanups already applied,
   minted atomically so no pre-cleanup state ever exists as its own commit.

Never one commit total (that drops the template base), and never more than one
inspiration commit (intermediate commits would leak pre-cleanup state). The
`rev-list --count > 1` and `merge-base --is-ancestor` checks below enforce this.

The published history must be **the public template's full history with
EXACTLY ONE new commit on top** -- the template's commits, unchanged, capped
by a single commit that carries ONLY this mind's changes (the delta over
`BASE_REF`). "One commit" here means **one commit OF CHANGES, never one commit
TOTAL.** The distinction is load-bearing and is the single easiest thing to
get wrong:

- **Right:** `git commit-tree ... -p <BASE_REF> ...` -- a new commit parented
  on `BASE_REF`, so `BASE_REF` and its entire ancestry come along in the push.
  The published `main` therefore has MANY commits (the template's whole
  history) plus this one snapshot on top. That is correct and expected -- a
  correct publish is NEVER a single-commit repo.
- **Wrong:** collapsing everything -- the base template included -- into one
  parentless/orphan commit (e.g. an empty `<BASE_REF>` so `git commit-tree`
  silently drops `-p`, a `git checkout --orphan`, a full-history squash, or a
  `git init` of the final tree). This also *looks* like "one commit," which is
  exactly why the mistake happens, but it throws away the shared base.

Why the shared base matters: because the published repo keeps `BASE_REF` and
its ancestry, it shares a real **merge-base** with the template and with every
other inspiration built on that template. That common ancestor is what lets an
adopting mind cleanly **merge this inspiration into itself (or into another
template)** -- a 3-way merge against `BASE_REF` brings in exactly this
snapshot's changes and nothing else. An orphan single-commit repo has NO common
ancestor with anything, so adopting it degenerates from "merge just the
changes" into a whole-tree conflict (or a blind overwrite). Keeping the base
history is what makes an inspiration composable with other templates rather
than a dead-end snapshot.

The worker's branch accumulates intermediate commits (the
raw assembly, then the modification/manifest/thumbnail follow-ups, then any
§6 edits) -- pushing the branch would publish every intermediate state, and
a published-version modification would leak the very thing it removed (a
real publish leaked a personal email exactly this way: it was generalized in
a follow-up commit, so the pre-cleanup assembly commit shipped too). So mint
a fresh commit from the FINAL tree, parented directly on `BASE_REF`, and
push that commit -- the branch itself is never pushed:

```bash
( cd "$WT" \
    && SNAPSHOT_COMMIT="$(git commit-tree 'HEAD^{tree}' -p <BASE_REF> -m "inspiration: <slug>

Assembled on clean DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE base <BASE_REF> (provenance link only; no upstream fetch).")" \
    && git merge-base --is-ancestor <BASE_REF> "$SNAPSHOT_COMMIT" \
    && test "$(git rev-list --count "$SNAPSHOT_COMMIT")" -gt 1 \
    && git \
    -c "http.extraHeader=X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password: $LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD" \
    -c "http.extraHeader=X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override: $LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE" \
    push "$LATCHKEY_GATEWAY/gateway/https://github.com/<owner>/<repo_name>.git" "${SNAPSHOT_COMMIT}:refs/heads/main" )
```

The two checks between the mint and the push are the guard against the
"one commit TOTAL" failure above, and they run BEFORE anything reaches the
remote: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <BASE_REF> "$SNAPSHOT_COMMIT"` fails
(aborting the `&&` chain) unless the snapshot is genuinely parented on the
base, and `rev-list --count > 1` fails if the mint came out parentless
(an empty `<BASE_REF>` makes `git commit-tree` drop `-p` and produce a lone
orphan). If either check fails, nothing is pushed -- STOP, re-resolve
`BASE_REF` per §2 (its tree must name `pyproject.toml` and `system/supervisord.conf`),
re-mint, and only then push. A correct push always lands MORE than one commit
on `main`.

Pushing `<sha>:refs/heads/main` publishes only that one commit plus the base
history it is parented on, so the published tree is exactly `$WT`'s final
state and NO intermediate assembly state exists anywhere off this machine.
The gateway proxies git's smart-HTTP endpoints and injects the GitHub
credential server-side (gated by the `github-git-write` permission from §7);
the two extra headers are the gateway's own auth material, already in this
container's environment. The mind's own commit history never leaves the
machine either (`build_inspiration.sh` parents the assembly commit on
`BASE_REF`; the minted commit here is parented there directly). No GitHub
token appears anywhere -- not in the URL, not on disk -- and nothing is
written into git config or a named remote (the `-c` options apply to this
one command only; nothing to clean up afterward).

**Step 3 -- tag the repo (immediately after a successful push).** Every
published inspiration carries the `minds-inspiration` GitHub topic -- a repo
topic, NOT part of the description -- so inspirations are discoverable as a
group (topic search / GitHub's topic page):

```bash
latchkey curl -X PUT "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo_name>/topics" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"names": ["minds-inspiration"]}'
```

(GitHub topic rules: lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only -- the fixed
literal `minds-inspiration` already conforms; do not prefix it with `#`. If
this call fails, the publish itself already succeeded -- retry once, and if
it still fails, report it as a minor follow-up rather than treating the
publish as failed.)

**Step 4 -- record the version entry in the source workspace (ONLY after the
push succeeded).** This is the single sanctioned write back to `/home/user/workspace` -- read
the exception in the CWD-INVARIANT callout at the top of this skill before
running it. Nothing is recorded for a publish that did not happen: if step 2's
push failed, or the user aborted, SKIP this entirely.

Write the entry directly into `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` (cwd `/home/user/workspace`). There is
no helper skill: this block is the whole recording contract, and it owns the
format so `publish-inspiration`, `update-published-inspiration`, and `update-self` all
write identical lines. Rules: append-only (existing lines copied through
verbatim, never re-flowed); every `## Inspirations` line ends in a commit; and a
retried step must be a no-op, never a duplicate. Inputs: `SLUG=<slug>`,
`REPO_URL="github.com/<owner>/<repo_name>"`, `NOTE="first published"`, and
`SOURCE_SHA` from §2 -- the source workspace commit the snapshot was cut from
(NOT `BASE_REF`, not anything from `$WT`).

- **If `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` is missing** (deleted since creation), recreate
  the shipped starter first -- the `# Version history` heading, its explanatory
  paragraph, and the empty sections `## Workspace`, `## Migrations`,
  `## Inspirations`, `## Adopted inspirations` in that order (byte-identical to
  the shipped root file; `update-self` §5b carries the exact heredoc) -- then
  append.

- **Seed the `## Workspace` origin line if it is absent** -- exactly once per
  workspace, as the FIRST line under `## Workspace`. Resolve the template base
  as the **OLDEST** first-parent template-state marker (`^update-self:` or
  `Initial workspace commit`; fall back to the first-parent root), and resolve its
  date/version/sha from that commit itself. **Use `git describe --tags
  --abbrev=0 --match 'minds-v*' "$CREATION"` (reachability), NEVER `git tag
  --points-at`** -- no tag is ever *on* a template base (an `Initial workspace
  commit` sits on top of the cloned template; an `update-self:` marker is a merge
  commit; the `minds-v*` tag is always on an ancestor), so a pointing-at lookup
  comes up empty and the line would silently degrade to the unnamed `created from
  the workspace template` fallback. Insert `- <date>  created from <version or
  "the workspace template">  <7-char sha>`, note padded to width 26. (This is the
  OLDEST-marker end of §2's `BASE_REF` walk -- same markers, opposite pick.)

- **Append the inspiration entry.** Create the heading `### <slug>  --  <repo-url>`
  under `## Inspirations` if this slug has none yet. Then append one line under
  that heading:

  ```
  - v<n>  <today, YYYY-MM-DD>  first published  <7-char SOURCE_SHA>
  ```

  where `<n>` is **computed**, never typed: it is one greater than the highest
  `v<k>` already listed under this slug's heading (so a first publish is `v1`, and
  a later `update-published-inspiration` run appends `v2`, `v3`, ... under the same
  heading). Pad the note (`first published`) to width 35 so the sha lines up.
  Compute the sha as `git rev-parse --short=7 "$SOURCE_SHA"`.
  **Idempotence, scoped to this slug** (two inspirations published from the same
  commit on the same day legitimately share a note and a sha): if a line already
  under this slug's heading carries this exact note AND this exact 7-char sha, it
  is already recorded -- change nothing and skip the commit below.

Then commit exactly this one file:

```bash
( cd /home/user/workspace \
    && git add docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md \
    && git commit -m "version history: published inspiration <slug> v1" )
```

Exactly that: one file staged by name, one commit, on whatever branch `/home/user/workspace`
is already on. NEVER `git add -A`, never a merge, checkout, or reset. If the
idempotence check found the entry already recorded, nothing is staged and you
skip the commit.

If the commit fails (e.g. a hook rejects it), the publish still succeeded --
say so plainly, and fix the entry rather than re-pushing anything.

**Failure handling.** A failure anywhere in this section means step 4 never
runs: an unpublished inspiration is never recorded in `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md`.
If the create fails, read the response body: a
`"request not permitted by the user"` error means the `github-rest-api`
grant is missing or too narrow -- go back to §7; a name-taken error means
asking in chat for a new name and retrying step 1. If the push fails,
diagnose before retrying step 2 -- do NOT re-create the repo:

- "request not permitted by the user" means the `github-git-write` permission
  is missing -- go back to §7.
- A request-body-too-large rejection (HTTP 413) means the user's minds app is
  older than the gateway's raised body cap and cannot proxy a push this size;
  report that plainly and stop.
- A rejection mentioning `workflow` scope means the stored GitHub credential
  cannot push `.github/workflows/` files (the template ships them); report it
  and stop rather than stripping files.
- A **GitHub secret-scanning / push-protection** rejection (e.g. `GH013:
  Repository rule violations`, "push cannot contain secrets") that names a
  **Google OAuth client ID or secret** -- a `GOCSPX-...` value or a
  `...apps.googleusercontent.com` client ID, found under `system/vendor/mngr` -- is
  EXPECTED and safe. This is the shared **Minds-provided** Google OAuth client
  baked into the template (`MINDS_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` /
  `MINDS_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in
  `system/vendor/mngr/libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/core.py`); it is the
  app's built-in Google sign-in client that ships with every mind. It is NOT
  the user's own secret and NOT the user's data, and it is safe to publish.
  Do NOT strip it, rewrite the template, or treat the publish as failed.
  Instead, explain this to the user in plain language and tell them it is okay
  to approve: they open the "allow secret" / bypass link GitHub prints in the
  rejection (or their repo/org push-protection page), approve it, and then you
  retry the push (step 2). Only the user can click that approval -- surface the
  link and the explanation, then wait.

Keep the assembled commit intact in `$WT` throughout. For fixable causes,
fix and retry the failed step until it succeeds or the user aborts; for the
stop-and-report cases above, stop.
**Never fall back to publishing a different, non-bootable thing** (e.g.
uploading just the selected app files through the API instead of pushing
`$WT`'s full assembled tree) -- see the "MUST BE BOOTABLE" callout at the top
of this skill. If you cannot get the documented flow to succeed, stop and
report the blocker; do not improvise a substitute publish.

## 9. Accumulation

Publishing a mind that already holds `inspiration-*.md` manifests plus their app
dirs carries ALL of them forward into the new repo alongside the newly-published
one -- they are part of the assembled tree. The generated `/welcome` targets
only the newly-published slug (the latest).

## 10. Close out

On a successful push, clean up per `launch-task`'s conventions: the worker can
be destroyed now (destroying it removes its worktree, i.e. `$WT`), and the
local branch can go too -- the published snapshot commit was minted from the
branch's final tree and lives on the new remote (the branch's intermediate
commits were never pushed, by design):

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py destroy --name <slug>
git worktree prune
git branch -D "mngr/<slug>"
```

(No git remote cleanup is needed: §8 pushes to an explicit URL and never adds
a named remote.)

The version entry was already committed in `/home/user/workspace` by §8 step 4; there is
nothing further to record here.

If the push failed and you are stopping (user aborted, unrecoverable error),
leave the worker, `$WT`, and the `mngr/<slug>` branch intact instead -- do not
delete work the user may want to retry or reassemble from.

Close the delegation step with a work-summary line. Report the new repo URL in
your final assistant message to the user (not in the step summary).

## The assembly script: `system/scripts/build_inspiration.sh`

The worker runs `system/scripts/build_inspiration.sh` from its worktree root (§3). It
is self-contained (the dev `create-new-mind-repo` recipe is NOT available in
the VM). Interface (cwd = worktree repo root):

```
.agents/skills/publish-inspiration/scripts/build_inspiration.sh \
  --base-ref <BASE_REF> \          # DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE commit the mind was based on (provenance + clean base)
  --slug <slug> \
  --title <title> \
  --include <path> [--include <path> ...] \   # repo-root-relative app/feature paths to overlay
  [--data-include <path> ...] \    # non-personal data (included by default); personal data excluded; boundary cases asked -- see §1
  [--description <text>]
```

What it does, in order (see the script for the exact commands):

1. Validates that the `--base-ref` tree names `pyproject.toml` and
   `system/supervisord.conf` (a bootable template base); exits 5 with a clear
   message otherwise, before touching the worktree (see §5).
2. Stages the selected paths out of the worker's checkout into a scratch dir
   (preserving relative paths) BEFORE resetting.
3. Resets the worktree to the clean base with
   `git read-tree -u --reset <BASE_REF>` then `git clean -fdxq` -- this drops
   tracked-but-not-in-base files AND gitignored cruft (secrets, runtime state,
   including the worker's `data/` task file). It never
   `git checkout <ref> -- .` (that leaks the mind's whole committed tree) and
   never fetches/pulls upstream.
4. Overlays the staged paths onto the clean base with
   `rsync -a "$STAGE/" "$REPO/"` (root-to-root contents merge) -- never a
   nesting copy like `cp -a "$STAGE/apps" "$REPO/apps"`.
5. Carries forward any existing accumulated `inspiration-*.md` + `.svg` at the
   repo root.
6. Runs a deterministic secret scan that HARD-FAILS (non-zero, abort before any
   commit/push). The scan is the sibling `scan_secrets.sh` over the staged
   overlay: TWO scanners -- betterleaks (configured by the sibling
   `betterleaks.toml`: its default ruleset plus the credential-filename
   blocklist and a broader Anthropic key rule) and kingfisher (always
   `--no-validate`) -- where a finding from EITHER of them, any scanner error,
   or any missing scanner binary fails the scan. There is no fallback scanner.
   This is the authoritative blocker, not LLM prose.
7. Generates the manifest `inspiration-<slug>.md` at the repo root (with the
   FILL-IN blocks the worker must replace), carrying the inspiration's
   `version: v1` in its front-matter and a "Recipe" block -- the include paths
   it just overlaid, plus the `exclude` / `modification_rules` lists the worker
   fills in. The recipe is what a later update re-runs, so the published repo
   is its durable home.
8. Generates a placeholder thumbnail `inspiration-<slug>.svg` carrying a
   distinctive `minds-placeholder-thumbnail` marker comment; the worker MUST
   replace the whole file with a bespoke SVG before reporting done, and the
   marker makes §8's pre-push gate a deterministic grep.
9. Overwrites the snapshot's `welcome/SKILL.md` with a generated
   inspiration-specific welcome describing the
   newly-published inspiration.
10. Removes `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` from the snapshot entirely: that ledger is
    WORKSPACE-only -- the SOURCE mind's own record of what it came from and
    everything it has published -- and never belongs in a published inspiration.
    A mind created from this inspiration grows its own ledger on demand (this
    skill's §8 step 4 and `update-self` §5b write the starter the first time it
    is needed), so nothing is lost by omitting it. Runs after the no-diff guard, so it can
    never make an empty include set look publishable.
11. Validates `system/supervisord.conf` WITHOUT starting the daemon (never
    `supervisord -t`), then makes a single commit for the assembled snapshot.
