"""Deterministic helpers for pulling an old Minds workspace into this one.

The migration is mostly agent judgement -- deciding what a user-authored file
*means* in the new tree, whether a migrated app actually shows the user's own
data, which of two colliding ports to keep. This script owns the parts that are
mechanical, and therefore belong in tested code rather than agent prose. Every
subcommand prints JSON on stdout.

Source inspection (each reaches the old workspace over the brokered SSH session,
so all of these take the ``--ssh-*`` options):

``detect-layout``
    Classify the source tree as pre-declutter or current-layout by inspecting it,
    and report the roots (repo checkout, mngr host dir, worktrees) that follow
    from that. The version range is context, not the test: a pre-0.3.9 workspace
    has no version marker on disk at all.

``baseline-diff``
    Resolve the source's own template base -- the NEWEST first-parent
    template-state marker (``update-self:`` or ``Initial workspace commit``) --
    and diff the source's checked-out tree against it. That yields what the user
    authored in that workspace and excludes template-version drift by
    construction. No resolvable base means no automation.

``list-agents``
    Enumerate the source's agents from ``<host_dir>/agents/*/data.json`` and
    ``<host_dir>/preserved/``, and map each to its session JSONLs via
    ``claude_session_id_history``.

``classify-branches``
    Split the source's ``mngr/*`` branches into merged (tip already reachable
    from the checked-out branch) and unmerged (carrying work the migrated tree
    does not contain).

``list-ports`` / ``list-jobs``
    The source's registered app ports (registry file + supervisord program
    blocks) and its scheduled-job entries, with each job command path-rewritten
    for this workspace.

``audit-scan``
    Grep named source files for latchkey call sites, AI-integration call sites,
    hard-coded legacy paths, and references to retired skills.

Local (no SSH):

``map-paths``
    Map legacy repo-relative paths onto their current-layout counterparts,
    flagging the ones that are genuinely ambiguous rather than guessing.

``rewrite-refs``
    Rewrite legacy path references inside already-migrated files, reporting every
    substitution it made.

``recreate-agents``
    Recreate each enumerated agent here via ``mngr create --template chat
    --adopt <session.jsonl>`` and stop it, so its full history renders in a tab
    and a message revives it. Idempotent: already-recreated agents are skipped.

Deliberately NOT scripted: deciding an ambiguous path mapping, judging whether a
rewritten skill still means what it meant, semantic porting of template-file
edits, and the verification checklist. Those need open-ended reading, and a
helper that pretended to cover them would give the agent false confidence -- so
an incomplete or ambiguous result is reported as such and handed back to prose.

The git/ssh/mngr-touching subcommands are thin wrappers over the pure functions
below, which carry all the logic and are covered by ``migrate_workspace_test.py``.
