# Updating an existing creation

This is the **change** lead of the generic creation lifecycle. The creation
already exists; you dispatch a generic worker to harden the change in the
background, proxy its gates, merge, and go live. There is one flow with a
**design-gate toggle** keyed on whether the change is already committed.

## The two origins

- **committed** -- you and the user discussed the change live and it is already
  committed on the branch. The design was approved organically in chat, so the
  worker skips the design gate, reads the committed diff as ground truth,
  verifies it, and presents the final gate.
- **emergent** -- a skill ran but additional *repeatable* work had to be done by
  hand, with no design conversation. The worker reconstructs the incident from
  your transcript, runs a design gate (Gate 1), implements, runs scenarios, and
  presents the final gate.

Pick **committed** when the user was explicitly in the design loop *and* the
change is already committed. Otherwise **emergent** (the safe default; its
Gate 1 re-surfaces the design for an approval pass).

**Confirm the user actually wants the change before you dispatch (committed
origin).** Applying a change live is not the user approving it. Do not launch
the hardening worker in the same turn you made the change: end that turn by
surfacing the change and asking whether it's what they wanted, and only invoke
this flow once they've given a clear go-ahead. Like any incremental work this
can take **several rounds** -- the user may keep responding with adjustments;
treat each as another live iteration and do not launch the worker until you
are sure they're satisfied with the update, not just at a single mid-thread
"looks fine." (The emergent origin is transparent work with no live change to
approve, so this gate doesn't apply there; its Gate 1 covers design approval.)

"Repeatable" covers deterministic extensions (an extra flag, a new output
format), model-judgement extensions (an additional judgement step with a stable
recipe, scripted as `[ai-script]`), and executor meta-work. One-off creative or
exploratory work is NOT an update candidate.

## The type parameter

`type` is `skill`, `app`, `service`, or `system-interface`. It drives where the
worker looks (`type-<TYPE>.md`) and the **go-live** strategy (Step 4):
skill → cross-reference sweep is part of the edit, nothing else; app →
refresh the tab (a background service has no tab -- restart it instead);
system-interface → the `update-system-interface` wrapper owns a
preview-before-merge and a `safe-reveal` go-live and calls into this flow for
the orchestration core only (see that skill).

## Conventions

Use `$TARGET` for the creation (e.g. `migrate-config`, an app or service name). Then:

- Worker agent name and branch: `update-$TARGET` / `mngr/update-$TARGET`
- Runtime dir / task file: `data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/` /
  `data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/task.md`

## Step 1: Open a tracking ticket

**Single-flight check first.** At most one harden pass per creation may be in
flight (counting `heal` passes on the same target). Run the pre-dispatch check
in [`.agents/shared/references/harden-contention.md`](../../shared/references/harden-contention.md);
if another agent's pass is live, leave the note it describes on their ticket
and stop -- the superseding pass forced at their merge time covers your change.
Only dispatch if no pass is live (or you took over an abandoned one).

```bash
mkdir -p data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET
TICKET_ID=$(tk create "update $TARGET" -t task \
    --acceptance "task file written; worker launched; worker DONE; branch merged")
tk start "$TICKET_ID"
```

## Step 2: Capture the change and write the task file

For the **committed** origin, capture the commit metadata and full diff so the
worker has a convenience index (the change is also on its branch on disk):

```bash
COMMIT_RANGE="HEAD~1..HEAD"   # widen to cover all commits implementing the change
git log --format='%H %s' "$COMMIT_RANGE" > data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/commit.log
git log -p "$COMMIT_RANGE"    > data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/commit.diff
```

Write the task file. Frontmatter carries `operation: update`, the `type`,
and the worker reporting fields (per
`.agents/shared/references/worker-reporting.md`). The body carries the
`## Change origin` marker the worker dispatches on, plus origin-specific content:

```bash
cat > data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/task.md << TASK_EOF
---
lead_agent: $MNGR_AGENT_NAME
finish_report_path: data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/reports/report.md
operation: update
type: skill

# Task: update \`$TARGET\`

## Change origin
ORIGIN: emergent

## Incident summary (emergent) / Committed change (committed)
<emergent: 2-5 sentences -- what the user asked for, how \`$TARGET\` fell short,
and the additional repeatable work you did by hand.>
<committed: branch, commit range (see commit.log), a summary of what changed and
why, and the design rationale the worker checks the diff against.>

## Anchors (verbatim quotes)
The worker uses these with \`mngr transcript\` to locate the relevant turns.
<emergent: the user's request, the insufficient \`$TARGET\` output, and a quote
showing the manual follow-up. committed: 1-3 quotes that pinned the design.>

## What the updated creation must do
<emergent only: the contract the creation must honor after the change -- inputs
it should now accept, outputs it should now produce. Describe the new contract;
the incident is captured above.>

## What to do
Use the installed \`harden-worker\` sub-skill. It reads \`operation\`,
\`type\`, and the \`## Change origin\` marker, then follows the matching
references. Push reports to the lead per its reporting protocol.

## Success criteria
- The change is hardened, tested, and passes the review gates on your branch.
- The user approved the final creation (Gate 2); for the emergent origin, also
  the outline (Gate 1).
TASK_EOF
```

Set `ORIGIN: committed` and `type:` as appropriate. Fill in the real
content; do not leave placeholders. The `## Change origin` marker is required --
the worker fails loudly if it is missing.

## Step 3: Launch the worker and poll

**Commit any pending changes before you launch, and never harden inline.** The
worker is created from your committed HEAD, so uncommitted changes never reach
it -- and `create_worker.py launch` refuses a dirty tree outright. Commit your
work first (the change being hardened is exactly what belongs on the branch);
**commit, never stash** -- stashed work gets lost during multi-agent
coordination. A dirty tree (even unrelated changes) is never a reason to do the
hardening inline: commit, then dispatch. Hardening always runs in the background
worker.

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py launch \
    --name update-$TARGET \
    --template subskill-worker \
    --runtime-dir data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/ \
    --task-file data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/task.md
```

Then background-poll (`create_worker.py await --task-file ... --timeout 90m`,
`run_in_background: true`) and follow `.agents/shared/references/lead-proxy.md`.
Flow-specific substitutions:

- Worker name: `update-$TARGET`; branch: `mngr/update-$TARGET`
- Poll path: `data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/reports/report.md`; reports dir
  `data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/reports/`; consumed
  `data/.tasks/harden/update-$TARGET/reports/consumed/`
- Gates: `outline-approval` (emergent only -- the design gate) and
  `final-creation` (both).
- Terminal statuses: `done` (go live, Step 4); `no-update-needed` (no change --
  close the ticket, no merge); `stuck` (failure flow per
  `.agents/skills/launch-task/references/worker-failure.md`).

## Step 4: Merge and go live

On `done`, first run the merge-time checks in
[`.agents/shared/references/harden-contention.md`](../../shared/references/harden-contention.md):
wait out any foreground editing lease on the service, confirm the branch is
still fresh (the creation's footprint has not changed since the worker
branched), and never hand-resolve a conflicted merge -- a stale or conflicted
pass is discarded and superseded by one new pass covering everything since the
last hardened merge.

Then merge `mngr/update-$TARGET` and go live by creation:

- **skill**: nothing beyond the merge (the worker's cross-reference sweep is part
  of the change). If the target is a built-in upstream skill, note the local
  drift to reconcile later via `update-self` / `submit-upstream-changes`.
- **service**: refresh the tab (`python3 system/scripts/layout.py refresh
  <service-name>`).
- **system-interface**: do **not** merge or reveal here -- the
  `update-system-interface` wrapper drives preview-before-merge and the
  `safe-reveal` go-live. (That wrapper uses this flow for Steps 1-3 only.)

Then close the ticket:

```bash
tk close "$TICKET_ID" "Updated $TARGET -- worker branch merged."
```

## Gotchas

- Update is non-blocking -- the user's original request is already delivered;
  the update worker produces a quieter follow-up commit.
- The committed origin's worker may produce no new commits of its own if
  verification is clean. That is expected -- the substantive change is already
  on the branch from the live commit.
