# worker it hands the merge to (``run-status delegate``), its one mid-flight
# hold and its clearing (``run-status hold`` / ``resume``), and its
# one terminal verdict (``run-status verdict``); the apply mirrors its marker's
# phase and restamp in alongside. The app's poll reads this file over ``mngr
# exec`` together with the run's chat agent, and needs nothing else -- it never
# opens the marker, and a run recorded here is visible to it whoever launched
# the run. One file per workspace: a new run's ``start`` overwrites the
# previous run's record, which is exactly the app's model (the last run's
# outcome stands until a new run supersedes it). The lease is what keeps that

# content match the pre-apply HEAD again -- so without a separate file the one
# state that most needs to speak is the one nothing can see.
EMERGENCY_FILENAME = "emergency.json"

# The provisioning-incomplete record, written when an update landed healthy

# services consistent and re-running the provisioner is cheap and
# merge-independent, so it does not roll the whole release back -- but the
# gap must not be silent either: this record (the same durable shape as the
# emergency one) is what the skill reads to re-run the provisioner after the
# fix, and it comes down only when a provisioner run succeeds.

# healthy on the merged tree -- so there is no phase past the restart: the
# post-success bookkeeping (ledger, env-converge) runs marker-free, because an
# interruption there must never read as an update worth rolling back.
#
# INVARIANT: the marker is on disk before anything that can disturb the live
# interface. The restart is the last phase, and every earlier phase works on
# the side (even the pre-flight boots the merged backend on its own port), so
# by the time the workspace's interface can stop answering, the marker has
# been present for the whole apply. The Minds app's misdiagnosis guard depends
# on exactly this ordering -- its stuck-edge probe reads the marker over
# ``mngr exec`` *after* an outage begins, and declines unattended recovery on
# finding it -- so a reordering that lets a service-disturbing step precede
# the marker write would silently break that guard.
