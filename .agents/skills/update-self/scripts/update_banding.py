    cron, a terminal: the kernel only refuses an ``oom_score_adj`` below the
    lowest value the process has ever held (inherited across fork), and nothing
    in the container has ``CAP_SYS_RESOURCE``, the one capability that raises
    that floor, so it stays at 0 for every process tree (measured on the
    docker, lima and imbue_cloud providers). Best-effort all the same: an apply
    that cannot be protected is still an apply worth running. Called from
    ``__main__`` rather than from the command functions so exercising them in
    a test cannot re-band the test runner.
