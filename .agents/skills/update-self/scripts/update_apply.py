"""``apply`` lands a prepared merge and makes the live workspace consistent with
it, as one deterministic, idempotent, rollback-on-failure motion: merge,
state snapshots, dependency refresh, provisioner run, frontend build (or the
worker's already-built bundle), pre-flight, the workspace layout migration
(warning-only), restart, health probes, the version-history ledger entry, and
the environment converge. On any failure it
reverts the entire merge and restores the pre-apply snapshots -- a recovery
path needing no network, no package manager, and no working ``mngr``.

It serves every update flow, not just update-self: ``update-system-interface``
hands it an ordinary merge and its own already-built bundle, so both flows
land the same way. What it must protect is therefore whole-repo -- the root
venv, the uv tool environments (the mngr tool and each critical app's own),
``node_modules`` and the built bundle are all copied aside first -- and what it
must survive includes its own death,
which is what the persistent marker and ``recover`` are for.

    """Roll back an interrupted apply from its marker.

    ``--if-stale`` is the unattended guard (boot and cron): act only when a
    marker exists, its recorded process is dead, and it has gone ``grace``
    without an update -- and stay silent in every normal state, because the
    cron runs forever. Bare ``recover`` is the explicit agent-driven rollback.

    ``--no-restart`` is the boot path: nothing is running yet, so disk state is
    the whole job (bootstrap starts the services fresh from the restored tree)
    and the health probes would only time out against a server that has not
    booted. The marker survives a failed *tree restore* (exit 1) so the next
    pass retries it; a rollback that restored the tree but could not put the
    pre-apply state back (boot path) or confirm a healthy workspace (live
    path) clears the marker and records the emergency (exit 3), like the
    apply's own emergency path -- re-running the same failed rollback from
    cron would not help, and the record is what makes the state visible once
    the marker is gone.
