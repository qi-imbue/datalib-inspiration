"""Deterministic helpers for the safe, background-worker-driven update-self flow.

The update-self orchestration is mostly agent judgement (triage conflicts,
decide validation depth, work the report's impact analysis). This script owns
the parts that are *deterministic* and therefore belong in tested code rather
than agent prose:

``resolve-target``
    Resolve the ref to update to. Default is the latest **stable** ``minds-v*``
    tag (semver-sorted, ``-rc``/prerelease excluded) that is **not newer than the
    minds app driving this workspace**; an explicit override may name a specific
    tag, ``main``, or any other ref, and is reported back as exceeding the
    ceiling when it cannot be proven to sit at or below it.

    The ceiling exists because a workspace's template ships the code the outer
    app talks to (the system interface, the vendored ``mngr``), so updating past
    the app's own release would leave the workspace speaking a protocol its app
    does not know. It is read from the app itself (``GET /api/v1/app/version``,
    baseline-allowed through the latchkey gateway, no grant needed); when it
    cannot be read the command **fails** rather than silently updating uncapped.

    The output also carries ``held_back_by_ceiling`` -- whether the ceiling, and
    not the user, is why a newer release was not taken -- alongside
    ``latest_available``, the newest stable tag upstream *ignoring* the ceiling
    (``null`` if there is none) and so the release that flag names.

    A default target the workspace is **already on** is a refusal too: the command
    asks git whether the chosen ref is already an ancestor of ``HEAD``, rather
    than spending a backup, a worker, and a validation run on a merge that changes
    nothing. This is what makes the ceiling bite for a workspace sitting *at* it:
    with a newer release upstream the refusal names the app as the reason it
    cannot be had, and without one it is a plain "already up to date". A workspace
    *behind* the ceiling still updates to it.

``classify-merge``
    Split the files upstream changed into the reconciled **merged** set (local
    also diverged there -- validate) vs the clean **pulled-in** set (local left
    it untouched, so the merge just took upstream -- trust as upstream-tested),
    and map each file onto its change class and its test project. This drives
    both validation depth (merged set) and what ``apply`` must do to make the
    live workspace consistent with the merge. ``has_merge_work``
    is the mechanical half of the review-gate rule: true whenever the merged
    set is non-empty (any merge work at all happened). A false value is
    necessary but not sufficient to skip the gates -- the worker's impact
    analysis must also find no user-created code affected, and the worker must
    have authored no in-branch edits of its own (which this diff cannot see at
    all); the worker reference owns that half.

``changelog-entries``
    List ``changelog/`` entries newly added between two refs -- the raw input for
    the worker's "what's new" report.

``surface-chat-tab``
    Open this run's own chat tab in the workspace UI, so a user sent into the
    workspace by the minds app lands on the conversation performing the update.
    The interface can only place a tab in front of a client that is connected,
    and the user may still be on their way in, so the command detaches a helper
    that retries ``layout.py open`` until one takes it (or a deadline passes)
    and returns at once; the open is a no-op on a tab that is already there.

``bootstrap-skill``
    Stage the copy of the update-self skill (SKILL.md, references, scripts) that
    the rest of the pass runs, at a single fixed path, and report whether it
    differs from the local copy. Normally that staged copy is the target ref's
    *own* copy (extracted from the already-fetched object); when the ref predates
    the skill it is the local copy instead. Either way the fixed path is left
    populated with a runnable flow, so the lead and worker can dispatch against it
    by literal path without carrying any value across shell invocations. This is
    what lets the flow, after resolving the target, hand off to the update-self
    process *as it exists at the version being updated to* -- so fixes to the
    update flow itself are applied live rather than being gated on the
    possibly-stale local copy. ``differs`` gates only which SKILL.md prose the
    lead follows, not the path.

``apply``
    Land a prepared merge and make the live workspace consistent with it, as
    one atomic, idempotent, rollback-on-failure motion inside a single
    near-OOM-exempt process: merge (fast-forward for update-self, ordinary for
    update-system-interface), pre-apply state snapshots, dependency refresh,
    provisioner run, frontend build (or the worker's already-built bundle),
    pre-flight, restart, health probes, the VERSION_HISTORY.md ledger entry,
    and ``env-converge upgrade``. On any failure it reverts the entire merge
    as a forward revert commit and restores the pre-apply snapshots -- plain
    file copies needing no network, no package manager, and no working
    ``mngr``. A full-information marker under ``data/.state/update-apply/``
    makes an interruption detectable: written before the merge, updated per
    phase, cleared on every exit path. Exit codes: 0 applied / 2 rolled back /
    3 emergency / 1 precondition (nothing changed).

``recover``
    Roll an interrupted apply back from its marker. ``--if-stale`` is the
    unattended guard (bootstrap at boot, the recovery cron every ~5 minutes):
    it acts only when the marker's recorded process is dead and the marker has
    gone a grace period without an update, and silently exits 0 in every
    normal state. ``--no-restart`` is the boot path (nothing is running yet,
    so disk state is the whole job). Bare ``recover`` is the explicit
    agent-driven rollback. Exit codes: 0 rolled back (or nothing to do) /
    1 the tree restore failed, marker kept for the next pass / 3 the tree is
    rolled back but the pre-apply state or health could not be put back
    (emergency recorded, marker cleared).

Impact analysis -- which services and skills depend on a changed file -- is
deliberately NOT scripted here: it requires open-ended exploration (imports,
shelled-out scripts, API-surface coupling) that a deterministic helper would
only pretend to cover. The worker reference owns that recipe.

This file is the command line: argument parsing and the git-touching wrappers.
The logic lives in the sibling modules, imported by name from this directory
(the whole ``scripts/`` directory is staged and run as one unit):
``update_target`` (which ref to update to), ``update_classification`` (change
classes and the apply plan), ``update_apply_contract`` (every path, phase,
verdict and record the Minds app, bootstrap and the system interface read),
``update_layout``, ``update_banding``, ``update_runtime``,
``update_environment``, ``update_probes``, ``update_ledger``, and
``update_apply`` (the apply and recover orchestration). All of it is covered
by ``update_self_test.py``.
