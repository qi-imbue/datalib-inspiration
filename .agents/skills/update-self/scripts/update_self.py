"""Deterministic helpers for the safe, background-worker-driven update-self flow.

The update-self orchestration is mostly agent judgement (triage conflicts, decide
validation depth, reveal by change class). This script owns the parts that are
*deterministic* and therefore belong in tested code rather than agent prose:

``resolve-target``
    Resolve the ref to update to. Default is the latest **stable** ``minds-v*``
    tag (semver-sorted, ``-rc``/prerelease excluded) that is **not newer than the
    minds app driving this workspace**; an explicit override may name a specific
    tag, ``main``, or any other ref, and is reported back as exceeding the
    ceiling when it cannot be proven to sit at or below it.

    The ceiling exists because a workspace's template ships the code the outer
    app talks to (the system interface, the vendored ``mngr``), so updating past
    the app's own release would leave the workspace speaking a protocol its app
    does not know. It is read from the app itself (``GET /api/v1/app/version``,
    baseline-allowed through the latchkey gateway, no grant needed); when it
    cannot be read the command **fails** rather than silently updating uncapped.

    The output also carries ``held_back_by_ceiling`` -- whether the ceiling, and
    not the user, is why a newer release was not taken -- alongside
    ``latest_available``, the newest stable tag upstream *ignoring* the ceiling
    (``null`` if there is none) and so the release that flag names.

    A default target the workspace is **already on** is a refusal too: the command
    asks git whether the chosen ref is already an ancestor of ``HEAD``, rather
    than spending a backup, a worker, and a validation run on a merge that changes
    nothing. This is what makes the ceiling bite for a workspace sitting *at* it:
    with a newer release upstream the refusal names the app as the reason it
    cannot be had, and without one it is a plain "already up to date". A workspace
    *behind* the ceiling still updates to it.

``classify-merge``
    Split the files upstream changed into the reconciled **merged** set (local
    also diverged there -- validate) vs the clean **pulled-in** set (local left
    it untouched, so the merge just took upstream -- trust as upstream-tested),
    and map each file onto its reveal class and its test project. This drives
    both validation depth (merged set) and reveal-by-class.

``changelog-entries``
    List ``changelog/`` entries newly added between two refs -- the raw input for
    the worker's "what's new" report.

``bootstrap-skill``
    Stage the copy of the update-self skill (SKILL.md, references, scripts) that
    the rest of the pass runs, at a single fixed path, and report whether it
    differs from the local copy. Normally that staged copy is the target ref's
    *own* copy (extracted from the already-fetched object); when the ref predates
    the skill it is the local copy instead. Either way the fixed path is left
    populated with a runnable flow, so the lead and worker can dispatch against it
    by literal path without carrying any value across shell invocations. This is
    what lets the flow, after resolving the target, hand off to the update-self
    process *as it exists at the version being updated to* -- so fixes to the
    update flow itself are applied live rather than being gated on the
    possibly-stale local copy. ``differs`` gates only which SKILL.md prose the
    lead follows, not the path.

Impact analysis -- which services and skills depend on a changed file -- is
deliberately NOT scripted here: it requires open-ended exploration (imports,
shelled-out scripts, API-surface coupling) that a deterministic helper would
only pretend to cover. The worker reference owns that recipe.

The git-touching subcommands are thin wrappers over the pure functions below
(``pick_latest_stable_tag``, ``resolve_target``, ``classify_path``,
``classify_merge``), which carry all the logic and are covered by
``update_self_test.py``. ``fetch_app_template_ref`` is the one impure helper, kept
to the narrow job of turning a ``latchkey curl`` result into either a ref string or
a ``CeilingUnavailableError``.
