# Worker: the review-gate rule

Whether the review gates run on an update merge is decided by a rule, not by
judgment. Apply it and record which branch applied, with its evidence, in the
report.

## Skip the gates only on a pure clean pull

All three must hold:

1. Step 4's `classify-merge` reports `has_merge_work` false -- an empty merged
   set: no conflicts, no file changed on both sides, no lockfile you
   regenerated.
2. Your 4a impact analysis found no user-created code (apps, skills, local
   scripts) depending on anything the update changed, and no global-dep bump
   with a user-created dependent. Built-in impacts do not block the skip.
3. You authored no in-branch edits of your own. A 4a mirror edit, or any
   other commit you added on top of the merge, is merge work even though
   `classify-merge` (which diffs `HEAD^1` against the base) cannot see it.

Every changed file then arrives exactly as upstream shipped and tested it, and
there is nothing local for a review to protect. Running `/autofix` here would
review *upstream's* code and could apply local fixes to it -- manufacturing
exactly the local divergence a future update would have to reconcile -- so on
a clean pull the skip is the correct outcome, not a shortcut. The report states
that this branch fired and shows the evidence for all three conditions.

## Otherwise run the real gates, scoped to the locally-divergent content

Follow the "Review gates" section of
`.agents/shared/worker/references/harden-creation.md`.

The gate's scope is **every file whose merged content differs from the target
release**: the conflicts you resolved with any hand-written content, your own
in-branch edits, and any lockfile you regenerated. A file byte-identical to
the release arrived exactly as upstream tested it, and a fix to it would only
manufacture local divergence. Over an 800-file release this is the difference
between reviewing four reconciled files and reviewing upstream's code. Name
the scope you ran in your report. Widening it is always allowed; narrowing it
below that set, or substituting a review of your own design, is not -- this
rule already *is* the proportionality decision. "The merge is dominated by
upstream-tested code" licenses the skip branch when its conditions hold, and
licenses nothing when they do not.

**Disposition of fix commits.** The test is the file's merged **content**, not
which set `classify-merge` put it in: **keep fixes to a file whose content
differs from the release** (one you reconciled by hand, or edited in-branch
yourself even though `classify-merge` lists it as pulled-in) and **revert fixes
to a file that is still byte-identical to the release** (note them as
`submit-upstream-changes` candidates instead), including a conflicted file you
resolved by taking upstream wholesale. The gate's job is the reconciliation and
local breakage, not improving upstream's code.

## The escape hatch

If you believe the gates should not run -- or should run at some other scope
-- in a situation this rule does not cover, that is a `question` gate for the
lead (Step 6), never a silent adaptation, however well-reasoned and however
openly you would have disclosed it. The lead answers it by this rule; where
the rule is genuinely silent, the fallback is more coverage, never less.
