name: update-self
description: Safely pull updates from the upstream template repo (default target is the latest stable release the running Minds app supports). Use when you want to incorporate upstream skills, script fixes, or config improvements. For pushing local improvements back upstream, use the `submit-upstream-changes` skill instead.
---

# Pulling updates from the upstream template, safely

This repo was created from a template repo and stays connected to it via a git
remote (`system/config/parent.toml` has the URL and branch). Upstream carries the shared
infrastructure: skills, scripts, `CLAUDE.md` scaffolding, `Dockerfile`,
`system/supervisord.conf`, the system interface, the vendored `mngr`.

Merging upstream can break the live workspace -- a settings-schema change the
running `system_interface` can't parse, a bumped `system/vendor/mngr`, a new service.
So, like `update-system-interface`, this flow never mutates the live tree from an
unverified state: an isolated **worker** does the merge and validation on its own
branch, and only a known-good, user-approved result is landed and applied.

You are the **lead**: resolve the target, dispatch the worker, proxy its one
gate, present the approval gate, and -- on approval -- land the merge and reveal
each change by its class. The worker owns the merge, the conflict triage, and the
validation; you own going live.

The default target is the **latest stable `minds-v*` tag** (released,
already-tested), not `origin/main` -- and never newer than the Minds app driving
this workspace, since the template ships the code that app talks to. The user may
override to a specific tag or to `main`.

Because the update flow itself evolves, once the target is resolved this pass
**re-points itself at the target version's own copy of the update-self skill**
(Step 2a) and runs the rest -- lead *and* worker -- from there. So a fix to the
conflict triage, validation, or reveal logic that shipped in the release is
applied on the way *in*, instead of staying a release behind in the local copy.
That copy is staged at one fixed path --
`data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self` -- which the lead
and worker both address by literal (no shell state carried between commands, since
each bash invocation starts a fresh shell).

## 1. Preconditions

**Back up first.** Before dispatching anything, capture a restore point of the
whole workspace so the pass is recoverable -- the reveal re-runs provisioners and
restarts services, and a backup is the recovery path if one of those goes wrong:

```bash
uv run host-backup-now
```

It waits for any in-flight backup, forces a fresh tick, and prints the tick's
terminal event -- exit 0 means `restic_backup_succeeded`; confirm that before
continuing. Exit 3 means backups aren't configured
(`tick_skipped_due_to_missing_secrets` -- no `data/.secrets/restic.env`), so there
is **no** restore point: tell the user, and get their explicit go-ahead before
proceeding without one. Exit 1 is a failed backup attempt; exit 2 means the
outcome could not be observed at all (the tick may still be running, or the
service is not writing events) -- neither confirms a restore point, so treat both
the same way as exit 3.

**Single-flight.** One pass at a time (its worker name, branch, and runtime dir
are fixed). Check for a live one:

```bash
tk ready > /tmp/update-self-inflight.txt
grep "update-self" /tmp/update-self-inflight.txt
```

If a live `update-self` ticket exists, stop and tell the user; if it looks
abandoned, take it over per `.agents/shared/references/harden-contention.md`.

**Clean tree.** The worker branches off your `HEAD` and the rollback captures it.
If `git status --porcelain` is non-empty, surface it and stop.

## 2. Resolve the target

Ensure the remote exists, fetch with tags, and resolve the ref:

```bash
git remote get-url upstream 2>/dev/null || git remote add upstream "$(python3 -c "
import tomllib
with open('system/config/parent.toml', 'rb') as f:
    print(tomllib.load(f)['url'])
")"
git fetch upstream --tags

python3 .agents/skills/update-self/scripts/update_self.py resolve-target --local-tags \
    > /tmp/update-self-target.json || exit 1
# `--local-tags` reads the tags the fetch above just landed (no second network
# round-trip). Honoring a user override, append e.g. `--override main` or
# `--override minds-v0.3.6` to the resolve-target call above. The `|| exit 1`
# leaves a refusal's `error:` line as the last thing printed -- without it the
# read below fails on the empty file and buries that line under a traceback.
cat /tmp/update-self-target.json
REF=$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("/tmp/update-self-target.json"))["ref"])')
```

`resolve-target` prints `{"ref": ..., "kind": "tag|branch|ref", "ceiling": ...,
"exceeds_ceiling": ..., "latest_available": ..., "held_back_by_ceiling": ...}`;
`main` resolves to `upstream/main` (not the stale local branch). Keep `$REF` in
your shell for the dispatch below, and tell the user which version you're
updating to.

**If the command exits non-zero, stop -- nothing is wrong with the workspace.**
It prints a single plain-language `error:` line saying why no target could be
chosen. Relay *that* line in plain terms per the §5a composition rules and offer
the next step; the usual reasons each have a different answer for the user: the
minds app could not be reached (it is closed, or the gateway is down -- retry once
it is running); the app is too old to report its version (update the minds app
itself first, then re-run); every release upstream is already newer than the app;
or the workspace is already on the release it may take -- which is either "you are
current" or "updating the app unlocks the newer one," and the `error:` line says
which. Do **not** work around it by resolving a ref by hand.

### The version ceiling

The default target is capped at the version of the **minds app driving this
workspace**, which `resolve-target` reads from the app itself (`ceiling` in the
output). This matters because the template carries the code the app talks to --
the system interface and the vendored `mngr` -- so a workspace running a template
newer than its app would be speaking a protocol the app does not know. When the
app reports a branch rather than a release tag (a dev build) there is nothing to
compare against and `ceiling` does not cap anything.

A workspace already sitting *at* the ceiling gets a refusal rather than a pass:
the capped target is the release it was created from, so there is nothing to
merge, and `resolve-target` says so instead of spending a backup, a worker and a
validation run on a no-op -- naming the newer release the app is holding back
when there is one. A workspace *behind* the ceiling still updates to it: being
capped is not the same as having nothing to gain, which is why the two cases are
distinguished by whether the resolved ref is already an ancestor of `HEAD` and
not by the ceiling alone.

**`"exceeds_ceiling": true` means the user's `--override` names a version this
app cannot vouch for** -- newer than the app, or a branch/commit whose version
can't be compared. Do not dispatch the worker on it silently. Tell the user
plainly what they asked for and what it risks ("that version is newer than your
Minds app, so parts of your workspace may stop working until you update the app
itself"), and **get an explicit go-ahead before continuing**. This is a separate
confirmation from the Step 5a approval gate, and it comes first: 5a asks whether
to apply a verified update, this asks whether to attempt an unsupported one at
all. An override at or below the ceiling needs no extra confirmation.

To preview what the release actually changes, always diff from the **merge
base**, never from `HEAD` -- a `git diff HEAD "$REF"` also shows every *local*
change as if upstream were reverting it, which reads as phantom upstream churn:

```bash
git diff --name-status "$(git merge-base HEAD "$REF")" "$REF"
```

### 2a. Hand off to the target's own update-self flow

Now re-point the rest of this pass at the update-self skill **as it exists at
`$REF`**. Stage that copy (from the already-fetched objects -- no network, no
working-tree mutation) at the fixed path
`data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self`, and learn
whether it differs from your local one:

```bash
DIFFERS=$(python3 .agents/skills/update-self/scripts/update_self.py bootstrap-skill --ref "$REF" \
    | python3 -c 'import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["differs"])')
echo "differs=$DIFFERS"
```

`bootstrap-skill` always leaves a runnable flow at that fixed path (the target's
copy, or -- when the ref predates the skill -- the local copy), so **the worker
runs from `data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self`
regardless**. `differs` decides only which `SKILL.md` prose *you* follow next:

- **`differs` is `False`** (the staged flow is byte-identical to yours, or the ref
  predates the skill) -> **continue with this document**.

- **`differs` is `True`** -> the target's copy of the flow differs from your local
  one (it shipped changes, or this workspace customized the flow locally). **Stop
  following this document** and follow the staged copy's `SKILL.md` from **Step 3**
  onward:

  ```bash
  # read and follow "data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self/SKILL.md" from Step 3
  ```

  You have already completed Steps 1-2 (backup, single-flight, clean tree, target
  resolved), so do **not** re-run the staged doc's Step 2 or re-stage -- just carry
  `$REF` forward into its Step 3.

Either way, `data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self` now
holds the copy of the flow to run. Everything below reaches the skill's scripts
and worker reference through that literal path (and points the worker at it), so
both dispatch against the correct version.

**The handoff contract (keep this boundary stable when editing this skill).**
Steps 1-2 -- preconditions and target resolution -- always run from the *local*
copy: they are what decide `$REF`, so by construction they cannot come from the
target. The target's flow is entered at **Step 3**. So an edit to this skill must
preserve that boundary: a future version's Steps 1-2 must stay "capture a backup,
the single-flight/clean-tree checks, then resolve a ref into `$REF`", and its
Step 3 must stay the worker dispatch -- otherwise an older initiator handing off
into a newer copy (or vice versa) lands at the wrong step. The version ceiling is
part of resolving `$REF`, so Step 2 computes it from the *local* copy -- which on
a workspace whose template predates the ceiling does not compute one at all.
Step 3a therefore re-checks it from the staged target copy before the dispatch,
so the cap holds on the very first update into it. Keep 3a in any future
version: it, not Step 2, is what protects a workspace arriving from an older
template. Keep the staging path
(`data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self`) stable for the
same reason. Note also that this handoff runs the target ref's `update_self.py`
and follows its prose *before* the Step 5a approval gate; for the default target
(a stable, already-tested `minds-v*` tag) that is the same trust basis as the
merge itself, but a `--override` to an untrusted ref means trusting that ref's
flow code and instructions -- only override to a ref you trust.

## 3. Dispatch the worker

### 3a. Re-check the ceiling from the staged copy (first, before anything else)

Run the version ceiling once more, from the **staged target copy**:

```bash
python3 data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self/scripts/update_self.py \
    resolve-target --local-tags --override "$REF" > /tmp/update-self-recheck.json || exit 1
cat /tmp/update-self-recheck.json
```

**This is not redundant with Step 2 -- it is the only ceiling check that runs on
a workspace updating *into* the ceiling for the first time.** Step 2 runs from
this workspace's *local* skill copy, and any workspace whose template predates
the ceiling has a local copy that does not check one: it happily resolves the
newest tag upstream, which is exactly the too-new target the ceiling exists to
refuse. The staged copy is by construction at least as new as `$REF`, so this
check runs no matter how stale the initiator was. That is precisely what §2a's
hand-off machinery is for -- "a fix that shipped in the release is applied on the
way *in*" -- and the ceiling is such a fix.

If `exceeds_ceiling` is `true` here and the user has **not** already confirmed an
over-ceiling `--override` in Step 2, stop and take that confirmation now, with
the same plain-language framing Step 2 describes. A default (no-override) resolve
that trips this means the local copy chose a target its app cannot support:
say so, and offer the ref this pass *would* cap to (re-run without `--override`
to learn it). Do not dispatch the worker until it is resolved.

**If the user takes the capped ref instead**, set `$REF` to it and then re-run
§2a for the new `$REF` before dispatching. Do not just reassign the variable:
§2a staged the skill at the *old* `$REF`, and the staged copy is what supplies
the worker guide, the `update_self.py` both of you run, and the prose you are
reading -- leaving it in place would run the too-new release's flow against a
target that is not it. `bootstrap-skill` re-stages destructively, so re-running
it is safe, and 2a's `differs` branch then decides which document you follow, as
on the first pass. The capped ref is by construction at or below the ceiling, so
the second time through 3a clears.

The boundary in §2a still holds: Step 2 is what *resolves* a target and Step 3 is
the worker dispatch. 3a resolves nothing -- it either clears the target Step 2
chose or hands the pass back to 2a with the ceiling's answer.

### 3b. Launch

Open a tracking ticket, write the task file, launch via the `launch-task`
machinery, and background-poll.

```bash
mkdir -p data/.tasks/update-self
tk create "update-self" -t task \
    --acceptance "worker launched; conflicts triaged; validated; branch merged; revealed"
```

Note the ticket id it prints, then start it. The tk hook requires `tk start` /
`tk close` to be the *only* command in their tool call -- never chain them after
another command or capture their output:

```bash
tk start <ticket-id>
```

Write the task file. Use the two-heredoc form the other worker skills use: an
**unquoted** frontmatter block so `$MNGR_AGENT_NAME` and `$REF` expand, then a
**quoted** body so its backticks stay literal:

```bash
{
cat << FRONTMATTER_EOF
---
lead_agent: $MNGR_AGENT_NAME
finish_report_path: data/.tasks/update-self/reports/report.md
target_ref: $REF
---
FRONTMATTER_EOF
cat << 'BODY_EOF'

# Task: safe update-self

## What to do
Follow the worker guide at
`data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self/references/update-self-worker.md`
end to end: trial-merge conflict triage, complete the merge (preserving the
`update-self:` merge-commit subject), validate the merged set, generate the
"what's new" report, and report `done`. That
`data/.tasks/update-self/skill-at-target/.agents/skills/update-self` path is the copy
of the update-self flow shipped with the version being updated to (staged by the
lead and synced into your worktree with this runtime dir) -- run *all* its
`update_self.py` calls from its `system/scripts/` too. Your target is the `target_ref` in
this file's frontmatter (already fetched into `upstream`).

## Reporting back
Per `.agents/shared/references/worker-reporting.md`. Valid `name:` values:
`question` (mid-flight gate for a genuine, unresolvable conflict), `done` /
`stuck` (terminal). Substitutions: `<TASK_FILE_GLOB>` -> `data/.tasks/update-self/task.md`;
`<RUNTIME_REPORTS_DIR>` -> `data/.tasks/update-self/reports`.
BODY_EOF
} > data/.tasks/update-self/task.md
```

Launch with the plain `worker` template (this flow uses its own worker guidance,
not the generic `harden-worker`), then background-poll (`run_in_background:
true`), re-arming per `lead-proxy.md`:

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py launch \
    --name update-self --template worker \
    --runtime-dir data/.tasks/update-self/ --task-file data/.tasks/update-self/task.md

uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py await \
    --name update-self --task-file data/.tasks/update-self/task.md --timeout 90m
```

## 4. Proxy the `question` gate

Per `.agents/shared/references/lead-proxy.md` (worker `update-self`, branch
`mngr/update-self`, reports dir `data/.tasks/update-self/reports/`). The worker
surfaces only genuine, unresolvable conflicts -- a real decision about how to
reconcile a file both sides rewrote incompatibly. **Escalate it to the user**,
relay their resolution via `mngr message`, consume the report, and re-arm.

**Compose the question per the §5a rules -- plain-language and pointed at a
resolution, not the worker's raw conflict dump.** Lead with where things stand
("The update is almost ready -- one file needs a decision from you before I can
finish"), explain the choice in plain terms (what the new version does vs. what
your workspace currently does, and what's at stake each way), and **propose a way
forward**: a recommended option when you have one, the concrete trade-offs when
you genuinely don't. Close by inviting the user to resolve it *with* you rather
than only to rule on it -- "tell me which you'd prefer, or talk it through with me
and we'll land on the best option together." Reassure that nothing has been
applied and the workspace is untouched.

## 5. Terminal status

- **`stuck`** or a dead-worker timeout -> surface via
  `.agents/skills/launch-task/references/worker-failure.md`. Nothing is merged or
  revealed; the live workspace is untouched. **Don't relay the raw failure, but
  don't strip the specifics either** -- this is the one message type where
  technical detail is *preserved, not dropped*, because the user often forwards a
  failure into a bug report and it must stand on its own to whoever reads it next.
  Compose it in two parts: a **plain-language lead for the user** (what happened
  and what it means -- "I couldn't complete this update cleanly; your workspace is
  untouched and nothing was applied" -- plus a next step or an offer to work
  through it together), followed by a **clearly-marked technical detail block for
  whoever they escalate to**: the target ref, the step or phase that failed, the
  specific file or component, and the **actual error text or log excerpt
  verbatim** (not paraphrased), with a pointer to the full report and logs under
  `data/.tasks/update-self/reports/`. Never leave the user at a dead end, and never
  hand them a failure so vague it's useless in a bug report.
- **`done`** -> the approval gate below.

### 5a. Approval gate

The `done` report is *your* raw material, not the user's message. It is a
comprehensive, technical digest for the lead -- changelog entries in range, the
conflicts and how the worker resolved them, reveal-class breakdown, impact
analysis, lockfile handling, and validation. **Do not forward it verbatim.**
Keep it available (it is persisted under `data/.tasks/update-self/reports/` -- offer
to show it if the user wants the specifics), and **compose a plain-language
approval message** from it. Then **wait for explicit approval** -- mandatory even
on a clean pull.

**These composition rules govern every user-facing message this flow produces --
the approval message here, the `question` gate (Step 4), and a `stuck` result
(Step 5) alike.** Whenever the update can't simply proceed, the message names the
blocker in plain terms and **proposes a way forward, or invites the user to
resolve it with you** -- it never dead-ends. The one thing that varies is how
much mechanism to keep: the approval and `question` messages drop technical
detail the user can't act on, but a `stuck` message deliberately preserves it
(Step 5) so it survives being pasted into a bug report.

Write the message a non-technical reader skims top-to-bottom, in this fixed
order:

1. **Verdict headline** (one line, first thing they see): "ready to apply,"
   "ready to apply, with one caveat," or "needs your input on X."
2. **Held back by your app version** -- include this line if and only if
   `held_back_by_ceiling` is `true` in the resolve-target output
   (`/tmp/update-self-target.json`). Say it in one plain line -- "there's a newer
   version available (`latest_available`), but it needs a newer Minds app than
   you're running, so I stopped at X" -- so the user understands why they aren't
   getting the newest thing and knows updating the app unlocks it. Do **not**
   derive this yourself by comparing `ref` against `latest_available`: those two
   also differ when the *user's own* `--override` picked an older tag, and saying
   "your app held this back" there blames the app for the user's choice. The flag
   already accounts for that.
3. **What's new** -- always first after the ceiling note. Keep this *detailed*:
   some readers want the specifics, others happily skim it as "great, they're on
   it." Do not thin it out -- carry the worker's digest, just in prose a lay reader
   parses (describe what each change does, not the file names).
4. **Conflicts** -- "none," or what needed reconciling.
5. **Validation** -- did the suite pass; is any failure pre-existing/unrelated.
6. **Caveats** -- only if any; what to expect after applying.
7. **Pre-existing issues** -- only if any, and only after verifying attribution
   (see the worker guidance's §4a): state plainly whether each lives in
   **built-in** code (present at the target ref -> report upstream) or the
   **user's own** code. Never call built-in code "workspace-added."
8. **The ask** -- see the language rule below.

**Detail in the informational sections (3-5); plain language at the decision
points.** Spend deliberate plain-language care only where the message asks the
user to **decide or act** -- the verdict headline, any caveat that needs their
action, and the closing ask. Those carry no jargon: never "merge," "land," or
"fast-forward" there. Frame the ask around *applying the update to their
workspace* (many users just want their workspace improved and don't think in
terms of merges), e.g. "Everything's ready -- want me to apply the update to
your workspace now?"

**Drop dependency/lockfile mechanics** from the user message unless there is an
action the *user* must take. **Command rule:** never print a command *you* will
run -- describe it in plain language ("I'll refresh it automatically if it comes
up"). Show a literal command only when the *user* must run it themselves.

**Preview rule for the system interface:** if upstream was strictly newer there
(no merge work needed), no preview is needed; if the worker's report says
nontrivial merge work was needed, give the user a live preview first, exactly as
`update-system-interface` Step 3 does (keep the worker alive until they
verdict). The report's per-surface merge-work judgment is what you go by.

```bash
WORK_DIR=$(mngr ls --include 'name == "update-self"' --format json \
    | python3 -c 'import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["agents"][0]["work_dir"])')
python3 .agents/skills/update-system-interface/scripts/reveal_system_interface.py preview \
    --slug update-self --work-dir "$WORK_DIR"
for L in desktop mobile; do python3 system/scripts/layout.py open --layout "$L" si-preview; done
```

The `open` loop targets both named layouts because mutating `layout.py` ops
require `--layout` and only apply on clients with that layout active; the call
for the layout the user is not on fails fast and harmlessly.

**Other user apps are optional previews.** When the report says another user
app took meaningful merge work, use your judgment: serve it from the
worker's worktree via `.agents/shared/scripts/serve_isolated_instance.py` as its
own preview tab -- or, when the system interface is also being previewed, link
it from inside that preview. Skip previews for services that came in clean.

### 5b. Land the merge

**When the update touches `system/apps/system_interface/` at all** (merged *or* pulled
in -- anything that makes 5c run the safe-reveal), first take the
`editing service system_interface` lease and hold it through the end of 5c,
exactly as `update-system-interface` Step 4 does: the reveal's auto-rollback
restores a captured revision, so a foreign merge landing between here and the
reveal could be swept away by it. Check `tk ready` for another agent's lease
and surface instead of proceeding if one is held; then `tk create "editing
service system_interface" -t chore` and `tk start` it (each as its own
command). Release it (tk close) after 5c.

Capture the rollback revision, then fast-forward the worker branch. It branched
off this exact `HEAD`, so the merge fast-forwards and **preserves the worker's
`update-self:` merge commit verbatim** (the marker `assist` relies on):

```bash
ROLLBACK_TO=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git fetch . mngr/update-self:mngr/update-self   # materialize the worker branch locally
git merge --ff-only mngr/update-self
```

If the fast-forward is refused, `HEAD` moved under the pass: treat it as stale
per `.agents/shared/references/harden-contention.md` and re-dispatch off the
current `HEAD` -- do not hand-resolve.

**Record the version, in the same landing.** Landing an update is what makes the
workspace a new version, so the entry belongs in the git tree, right here --
never left to a later turn. The merge sha only exists once the merge has landed,
so this is a follow-up commit of exactly one file (the worker never writes it --
only the lead knows the merge sha).

Capture the merge sha **right here** -- immediately after the fast-forward, while
`HEAD` still is the merge and before the ledger commit moves it:

```bash
MERGE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

Then write the entry directly into `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md`. There is no helper
skill -- this block is the whole recording contract, and it owns the format so
`update-self`, `publish-inspiration`, and `update-published-inspiration` all write
identical lines. The rules: append-only (existing lines are copied through
verbatim, never re-flowed); every `## Workspace` line ends in a commit; and a
retried landing must be a no-op, never a duplicate. Do the three parts below in
order.

**Part 1 -- if `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` is missing** (deleted since creation),
recreate the shipped starter first, then append. This heredoc is the canonical
starter that `publish-inspiration` and `update-published-inspiration` recreate by reference
to here:

```bash
[ -f docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md ] || cat > docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md <<'VERSION_HISTORY_EOF'
# Version history

Where this workspace came from, what it has migrated in, what it has published,
and the inspirations it has adopted. Entries are appended automatically -- by
`update-self` when it lands a template update, by `migrate-workspace` when it
pulls another workspace in, by `publish-inspiration` and
`update-published-inspiration` when they publish, and by
`update-installed-inspiration` when it pulls a newer version of an adopted
inspiration -- and earlier lines are never rewritten. Each Workspace, Migrations,
and Inspirations line ends in the commit it was cut from.

## Workspace

## Migrations

## Inspirations

## Adopted inspirations

Each inspiration this mind has adopted and the version it is on;
`update-installed-inspiration` appends here when it pulls a newer version.
VERSION_HISTORY_EOF
```

`## Migrations` is `migrate-workspace`'s section (one line per workspace pulled
in); this starter ships it empty so a recreated file already has it, and
`update-self` never writes there.

**Part 2 -- seed the `## Workspace` origin line if it is absent** -- exactly
once per workspace, inserted as the FIRST line under `## Workspace` (the oldest
event, so it never appends at the end). Resolve the template base as the
**OLDEST** first-parent template-state marker (`^update-self:` or `Initial
workspace commit`), and resolve its date/version/sha **from that commit itself**
so seeding late still records when the workspace was actually created:

```bash
if ! grep -q "created from" docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md; then
    CREATION=$(git log --first-parent --format='%H %s' HEAD \
        | awk '{h=$1; sub(/^[^ ]+ /,""); if ($0 ~ /^update-self:/ || $0 == "Initial workspace commit") last=h} END {if (last) print last}')
    # Fallback (a hand-made or pre-bootstrap repo with no marker): the FIRST-PARENT
    # root -- never `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`, whose parallel subtree roots
    # are not the seed.
    [ -n "$CREATION" ] || CREATION=$(git rev-list --first-parent HEAD | tail -1)
    C_DATE=$(git log -1 --format=%ad --date=short "$CREATION")
    C_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short=7 "$CREATION")
    C_VERSION=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'minds-v*' "$CREATION" 2>/dev/null)
    # Then insert `- <C_DATE>  created from <C_VERSION or "the workspace template">
    # <C_SHA>` as the FIRST line under the `## Workspace` heading, note padded to 26.
fi
```

**Use `git describe` (reachability), NEVER `git tag --points-at`.** No tag is ever
*on* a template base: `Initial workspace commit` is an `--allow-empty` commit
bootstrap writes ON TOP of the cloned template commit, and an `update-self:`
marker is a merge commit -- in both cases the `minds-v*` tag is on an ancestor, so
a pointing-at lookup always comes up empty and every origin line would silently
degrade to the unnamed `created from the workspace template` fallback. (This walk
takes the **OLDEST** marker -- where the mind *started*. `publish-inspiration`
§2's `BASE_REF` walk uses the same markers but takes the **NEWEST**; the
difference is load-bearing.)

**Part 3 -- append the update line.** Under `## Workspace`, after its last
existing line, append exactly one line of the form:

```
- <today, YYYY-MM-DD>  updated to <$REF>  <7-char $MERGE_SHA>
```

Pad the note (`updated to <$REF>`) to width 26 so the sha lines up; a longer note
just pushes its own sha right, and earlier lines are never re-flowed. Compute the
sha as `git rev-parse --short=7 "$MERGE_SHA"`. **Idempotence:** if a `##
Workspace` line already carries this exact note AND this exact 7-char sha, it is
already recorded -- change nothing and skip the commit below.

Then commit exactly this one file:

```bash
git add docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md
git commit -m "version history: updated to $REF"
```

Stage `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` **by name** -- NEVER `git add -A` (it would sweep
up the mind's unrelated working state), and never a merge, checkout, or reset as
part of recording. If the idempotence check found the entry already recorded,
nothing is staged and you skip the commit.

**Pass `$MERGE_SHA`, never `HEAD`.** The append de-duplicates on note + sha, and
the `git commit` above moves `HEAD` onto the version-history commit: a re-run
that reaches for `HEAD` would pass a different sha, defeat the no-op, and append
a second line pointing at the ledger commit instead of the merge. On a re-run,
re-derive the merge sha rather than re-reading `HEAD`:

```bash
MERGE_SHA=$(git log --first-parent --grep '^update-self:' -1 --format=%H)
```

That prints the newest template-state marker -- the merge you just landed -- and
keeps printing it afterwards, so the whole block is safe to re-run.

**Never give this commit an `update-self:` subject**: that prefix is the
template-state marker `assist` and `publish-inspiration` §2 resolve `BASE_REF`
from, it belongs to the merge commit alone, and `$MERGE_SHA` above depends on it
staying that way.

### 5c. Reveal by change class

The report says which classes merged. Apply each; a clean pull-in is still
*applied* (its dependent service restarted), only its validation was skipped.

- **`system_interface`** -- reveal via the safe-reveal script (rebuilds `static/`,
  refreshes deps on a manifest change, pre-flights, health-checks,
  auto-rolls-back), then tear down any preview:

  ```bash
  python3 .agents/skills/update-system-interface/scripts/reveal_system_interface.py reveal \
      --rollback-to "$ROLLBACK_TO"
  python3 .agents/skills/update-system-interface/scripts/reveal_system_interface.py unpreview --slug update-self
  for L in desktop mobile; do python3 system/scripts/layout.py close --layout "$L" si-preview; done
  ```

  Exit codes per `update-system-interface` Step 5 (`0` revealed; `2`
  auto-rolled-back; `3` emergency; `1` precondition). **On exit 2 the rollback
  reverts `$ROLLBACK_TO..HEAD` -- the entire landed merge, every class, not
  just the system interface.** Stop here: apply no other class (the tree no
  longer contains the update), surface the failure, and re-dispatch once the
  cause is fixed. Exit 3 means the restore itself failed -- surface immediately.

- **`service` / `system/supervisord.conf` / `bootstrap`** -- restart the whole services
  agent (do not use `supervisorctl reread && update` here), then refresh any
  affected tab (`python3 system/scripts/layout.py refresh <name>`):

  ```bash
  mngr start --restart system-services
  ```

- **`editable_tool` (`system/vendor/mngr/**`)** -- `.py` is picked up live; a manifest
  change needs an env refresh (`uv sync --all-packages`, or `uv tool install -e
  system/vendor/mngr --reinstall` for a tool entry point). Any other `is_manifest` change
  the report flags (a root-workspace `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`) likewise needs
  `uv sync --all-packages` so the new dependencies resolve.

- **`Dockerfile`** -- apply the live-applicable hunks the report calls out
  (canonically a `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` bump -> `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=<v> bash
  system/scripts/setup_system.sh`, keeping `agent_types.claude.version` in
  `.mngr/settings.toml` in sync). Tell the user any image-level hunk (base
  `FROM`, `apt-get` packages, build-time layout) needs a manual workspace rebuild.

- **`provisioner` (`system/scripts/setup_system.sh`,
  `system/scripts/install_secret_scanners.sh`, `system/scripts/_provision_guard.sh`,
  `.mngr/**`)** -- shapes how the workspace image and agents are *provisioned*,
  not live runtime code, so it doesn't reveal by merely restarting a dependent
  service the way `shared_runtime` does. Work the report's apply plan by sub-case:

  - A **pinned-toolchain bump** in `setup_system.sh` /
    `install_secret_scanners.sh` (canonically `LATCHKEY_VERSION`, but also `UV_`,
    `MODAL_`, `TTYD_`, `CLOUDFLARED_`, scanner pins) does **not** reach the live
    workspace on its own -- the globally-installed CLI stays at the old version
    until a rebuild. Apply it live by re-running the provisioner:

    ```bash
    bash system/scripts/setup_system.sh
    ```

    This now actually runs (rather than skipping): the merge changed the repo
    tree, so the content-addressed provision guard's marker no longer matches,
    and the script re-installs the pinned tools idempotently. The report names
    which pins moved.

    **Exception -- a bump the report flags as coupled to a *user-created*
    dependent.** The report says who depends on the bumped dep and classifies it
    by origin (not directory). If the dependent is **built-in** (its code is in the
    upstream template -- the same release tested it against the new dep),
    hot-running the provisioner is safe; apply it live as above. If the dependent
    is **user-created** (built in this workspace, absent from upstream -- e.g. a
    `build-app` app under `system/apps/`), do **not** hot-run
    the provisioner: upstream never tested that code against the new dep and the
    worker couldn't validate it either, so treat it as **rebuild-only** -- surface
    it to the user for a workspace recreate (which provisions the new substrate and
    re-runs the user code against it), exactly as an image-level hunk below.
  - A hunk that only affects a **fresh image build** -- something the idempotent
    re-run does not reproduce -- needs a **manual workspace rebuild**; tell the
    user, exactly as for an image-level `Dockerfile` hunk.
  - **`.mngr/**` create config** governs `mngr create`, so the merged file
    governs every *future* create automatically (a fresh workspace, and the
    sub-agents `launch-task` spawns) -- but the *current* workspace was built and
    launched under the **old** settings, so a create-time change does not reach it
    on its own. The worker's report carries a **per-change apply plan** (it
    best-effort mirrors each change into a live counterpart within the merge);
    carry it out:

    - **Live-applicable** (most changes, including env vars and agent behavior) --
      the worker already made the in-repo edits mirroring the change into its live
      counterpart (an env var into a `profile.d` entry / a supervisord program's
      `environment=`; a `settings_overrides` / `disable_plugin` change into what
      the running agent reads; a Claude/toolchain version pin into `setup_system.sh`
      / the Dockerfile). You run the restart the report names to make them take
      effect: re-run the provisioner for a mirrored toolchain pin, and/or `mngr
      start --restart system-services` (or a relaunch of the affected agent) so the
      next process start reads it. Keep lockstep pins (`agent_types.claude.version`
      vs the Dockerfile `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` and the installed binary) consistent.
    - **Rebuild-only for the current workspace** (the narrow remainder) -- only a
      container build/launch parameter an already-running container can't adopt: a
      `[create_templates.*]` / `[providers.*]` `build_arg`, `start_arg`
      (`--security-opt`, `--tmpfs`, `--cpus`, …), or runtime flag (`runsc` /
      `docker_runtime`). Flag it to the user as needing a workspace recreate,
      exactly as an image-level `Dockerfile` hunk; don't imply it is already live.

    (A change the worker judged neither live-applicable nor safe to defer to a
    rebuild comes back as `stuck`, handled in Step 5's terminal status -- nothing
    is landed.)

- **`shared_runtime` (`system/scripts/**` other than the provisioning scripts above,
  `system/libs/**`, `system/services/**`, `system/apps/**`, `.agents/**`)** -- applies to
  future agents automatically unless a live service depends on the file. The
  report's impact analysis names any live consumer; restart that service
  (usually `mngr start --restart system-services`). Only "nothing to reveal"
  when the analysis found none.

## 5c. Advance the environment (bundled, not optional)

update-self is the one moment package versions are allowed to move: the merged
template carries a (possibly newer) committed apt snapshot timestamp in
`.mngr/apt-snapshot-timestamp`, and the environment stays pinned to the OLD
timestamp until explicitly advanced. After the merge has landed and revealed,
run:

```bash
uv run env-converge upgrade
```

This re-renders the pinned apt sources at the new timestamp, `apt-get
full-upgrade`s against that frozen universe, re-runs the `system/scripts/env.d/`
units (whose pins may have advanced with the template), re-captures the
environment record, and prints the package-version deltas as JSON. Summarize
the delta count for the user in plain language ("system packages moved to the
newer pinned snapshot; N changed"). If the timestamp did not change, the
command is a cheap no-op pass -- run it anyway so unit-pin bumps still apply.

## 6. Teardown

If you previewed a non-system_interface service in 5a, tear that preview down
too: stop its isolated instance and close its tab on each named layout
(`for L in desktop mobile; do python3 system/scripts/layout.py close --layout "$L" <name>; done`).
Then:

```bash
mkdir -p data/.tasks/update-self/reports/consumed
mv data/.tasks/update-self/reports/report.md \
    data/.tasks/update-self/reports/consumed/$(date +%s)-done.md
uv run .agents/skills/launch-task/scripts/create_worker.py destroy --name update-self
```

Consuming the terminal report is not optional bookkeeping: `create_worker.py
launch` refuses to start a worker while a leftover report sits at the report
path (a stale one would satisfy the next pass's `await` instantly), so skipping
this breaks the next update-self pass until someone cleans it up.

Close the tracking ticket last (its own tool call, nothing chained):

```bash
tk close <ticket-id> "Updated to <ref> -- worker branch merged and revealed."
```
