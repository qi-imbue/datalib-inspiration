# Enable the Caretaker (BETA)

The Caretaker is a **beta** feature, off by default: a background agent that
checks this workspace about once a week -- crashed services, fresh errors in
the logs, a filling disk, memory trouble -- and opens a chat tab only when
there is something to say. Off by default means literally nothing runs: no
cron entry exists until this skill creates it.

Before enabling it, make sure the user genuinely wants it: say plainly that
it is a beta feature and they should not expect it to be polished or optimal,
and get their explicit confirmation. Only proceed on a clear yes.

To enable, write the Caretaker's schedule entry (durably, then live) and
clear any stale job state:

    mkdir -p /home/user/workspace/data/.state/cron.d
    printf '%s\n' '* * * * *   root   /home/user/workspace/system/libs/automations/with_agent_env.sh /home/user/workspace/system/libs/automations/run_job.sh caretaker --every 7d --at 3 bash /home/user/workspace/system/services/caretaker/caretaker_check.sh >> /var/log/supervisor/caretaker-job.log 2>&1' > /home/user/workspace/data/.state/cron.d/minds-caretaker
    install -m 0644 /home/user/workspace/data/.state/cron.d/minds-caretaker /etc/cron.d/minds-caretaker
    rm -rf /home/user/workspace/data/.state/jobs/caretaker

This is the standard recurring-job pattern from the manage-scheduled-tasks
skill: the every-minute tick is `run_job.sh` (weekly, due hour 3, catch-up
after downtime, and completion-tracked -- a check that fails or is killed
mid-run is retried within minutes instead of silently losing the week), and
`caretaker_check.sh` is the deterministic check that wakes the agent only
when it finds something. The copy under `data/.state/cron.d/` is the durable
switch (the bootstrap reinstalls it at each boot, so it survives container
recreation); the `install` makes it live immediately. Cron picks the file up
within a minute, so the Caretaker introduces itself shortly afterwards
(within a minute or two during the day; at about 3 AM if enabled in the
small hours), then checks weekly.

To switch it off again, use the disable-caretaker skill (remove both copies
of the entry); its notes and permissions stay put for a later re-enable.
