"""Reveal a merged system-interface change to the live UI -- and auto-recover if it breaks.

This is the reveal step of the ``update-system-interface`` flow. The lead agent
merges a verified worker branch into the served working tree, then runs this
script. It owns the *entire* reveal sequence as a single deterministic motion,
because the failure mode is catastrophic: if the ``system-interface`` backend
fails to start, the user loses their whole chat UI and there is nowhere left to
surface an error message. So detection is not enough -- this script must always
leave the served UI in a working state, on its own, without the agent.

What it does, given the pre-merge revision (``--rollback-to``):

1. Refuse to run on a dirty tree (so a rollback can never clobber unrelated work).
2. Classify what changed since the known-good revision (frontend src / frontend
   manifest / backend src / backend manifest).
3. Refresh dependencies only if a manifest changed (``npm ci`` / ``uv tool
   install -e system/apps/system_interface --reinstall``). A plain restart does NOT
   re-resolve the editable tool's dependencies, so a backend dependency add
   would otherwise crash the service on restart.
4. For a backend change, *pre-flight* the merged code on a throwaway port before
   touching the live service -- if it cannot boot, the live service is never
   restarted and we go straight to rollback (the UI never went down).
5. Build the frontend bundle, restart the backend, and tell open browsers to
   reload, as applicable.
6. Probe the live service's loopback endpoint until healthy (with a deadline).
7. On ANY failure, restore the served tree to the known-good revision (as a
   forward revert commit) and re-probe to *confirm* the UI is back. The live
   backend is restarted during recovery only if the failed reveal had already
   restarted it (a failed post-restart health check); when the failure happened
   before the live restart (pre-flight, dependency refresh, frontend build) the
   live service is still serving known-good code and is left untouched, so the
   UI never blips. Only then does the script exit -- reporting what happened via
   its exit code and stderr.

Run via bare ``python3`` (standard library only), like ``forward_port.py`` and
``reload_system_interface``'s predecessor -- it orchestrates the environment, so
it must not depend on any particular venv being synced.

The ``preview`` / ``unpreview`` subcommands are thin system-interface adapters
over the shared ``serve_isolated_instance.py`` motion (the previewable-instance
substrate every service flow shares). They hand it the system-interface
specifics -- boot ``uv run system-interface`` from the worker's already-built
``--work-dir`` on a free port, with layout persistence neutered (drop
MNGR_AGENT_ID so it can't clobber the live ``layout.json``) but agent discovery
kept, probe ``/api/agents``, and register the inner app plus the labeled
"preview" wrapper frame the user opens. The shared script owns the ports, the
process/service teardown, and the state file; no fetch, checkout, or rebuild
happens, and the served tree and the worker's folder are never touched. The
worker is a local git-worktree sub-agent whose work_dir is a folder it has
already built, and it must still exist at preview time.

The non-deterministic part -- opening the tab and gating on the user's judgment
-- stays with the agent.

Usage:
    python3 reveal_system_interface.py reveal --rollback-to <pre-merge-sha> [--repo-root PATH]
    python3 reveal_system_interface.py preview --slug <name> --work-dir <worker-work-dir> [--repo-root PATH]
    python3 reveal_system_interface.py unpreview --slug <name> [--repo-root PATH]

Environment:
    MINDS_WORKSPACE_SERVER_URL  Base URL of the live workspace server
                                (default http://127.0.0.1:8000).
    MNGR_AGENT_ID               Sent for telemetry on the reload broadcast.

Exit codes (``reveal``):
    0  Revealed successfully; live UI is healthy.
    1  Precondition error (dirty tree, bad arguments) -- nothing was changed.
    2  The change was bad and was rolled back; the live UI is confirmed healthy
       on the known-good revision (the requested change did NOT land).
    3  EMERGENCY: even rollback could not restore a healthy UI.

Exit codes (``preview`` / ``unpreview``):
    0  Success (preview is up / torn down).
    1  The preview failed to build or boot (and tore itself down), or a bad
       argument / unreadable state file.
