"""Preview a system-interface worker's branch before it is merged.

The ``preview`` / ``unpreview`` subcommands are thin system-interface adapters
over the shared ``serve_isolated_instance.py`` motion (the previewable-instance
substrate every service flow shares). They hand it the system-interface
specifics -- boot ``uv run system-interface`` from the worker's already-built
``--work-dir`` on a free port, with MNGR_AGENT_ID dropped (so the throwaway
boot never acts as the calling agent) but the live app registry read, so the
real chats still render, probe ``/api/health``, and register the inner app plus the labeled
"preview" wrapper frame the user opens. The shared script owns the ports, the
process/service teardown, and the state file; no fetch, checkout, or rebuild
happens, and the served tree and the worker's folder are never touched. The
worker is a local git-worktree sub-agent whose work_dir is a folder it has
already built, and it must still exist at preview time.

The *apply* step -- landing the merged change and revealing it to the live UI,
with auto-rollback -- belongs to the general update apply,
``.agents/skills/update-self/scripts/update_self.py apply``, which owns the
whole reveal machinery (snapshots, dependency refresh, pre-flight, health
probes, rollback, the interruption marker) for every update flow. This script
covers only the pre-merge preview, whose gating on the user's judgment is the
non-deterministic part that stays with the agent.

Run via bare ``python3`` (stdlib-only) -- it orchestrates the environment, so
it must not depend on any particular venv being synced.

Usage:
    python3 reveal_system_interface.py preview --slug <name> --work-dir <worker-work-dir> [--repo-root PATH]
    python3 reveal_system_interface.py unpreview --slug <name> [--repo-root PATH]

Environment:
    MNGR_AGENT_ID  Dropped for the preview boot so it never acts as the calling
                   agent.

Exit codes:
    0  Success (preview is up / torn down).
    1  The preview failed to boot (and tore itself down), or names a
       work_dir that carries no built bundle.
