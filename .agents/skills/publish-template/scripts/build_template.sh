# Assemble a clean, shareable "template" snapshot on top of the DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE base the
# mind was created from, then commit it. Run by the launch-task WORKER the
# publish-template skill dispatches, from the worker's own git worktree
# (cwd = worktree repo root); the live mind's /home/user/workspace is never touched. This is
# v2 of the templates flow (see TEMPLATE_FLOW_VERSION below); the
# generated manifest records it as `format: v2` in its front-matter and in the
# sibling template.toml.
#
# The dev `create-new-mind-repo` recipe is NOT available in the VM, so this is
# self-contained. It does the assembly + secret scan + manifest/thumbnail +
# /welcome rewrite + version-history removal + boot smoke-check + single commit.
# It does NOT create the
# GitHub repo or push, and it deliberately leaves two things unfinished for the
# worker to complete before reporting done: the manifest's FILL-IN blocks (real
# prose) and the placeholder thumbnail (a bespoke, app-specific SVG). The lead
# owns the chat confirmation, GitHub login, and push.
#
# Known-correct methods embedded here (a prior build got these wrong):
#   - Clean base via `git read-tree -u --reset` + `git clean -fdxq`, NEVER
#     `git checkout <ref> -- .` (which leaks the mind's whole committed tree,
#     incl. secrets). No upstream fetch/pull -- provenance link only.
#   - Overlay via `rsync -a "$STAGE/" "$REPO/"` (root-to-root), NEVER
#     `cp -a "$STAGE/apps" "$REPO/apps"` (nests into apps/apps).
#   - Secret scan is a hard-failing (exit-non-zero, abort-before-commit) gate
#     -- the authoritative blocker. It runs the sibling scan_secrets.sh, which
#     requires BOTH scanners (betterleaks with the sibling betterleaks.toml
#     config, kingfisher with --no-validate) and fails on any finding, any
#     scanner error, or any missing scanner binary. There is NO fallback
#     scanner: the binaries are baked into the workspace image, so a missing
#     one is a broken environment.
#   - Boot smoke-check via the supervisor python lib (realize/process_config),
#     NEVER `supervisord -t` (in supervisord, -t means --strip_ansi and LAUNCHES
#     the daemon).
#
# Exit codes: 0 = success; 1 = secret scan hit OR a required scanner was
# missing/errored; 2 = usage error; 3 = nothing to publish beyond the base;
# 4 = boot smoke-check failed; 5 = --base-ref does not resolve to a bootable
# template tree; 6 = the generated manifest failed validation, or a declared
# apt package does not resolve in the pinned snapshot mirror.

# read-tree -u --reset makes the index+worktree match BASE_REF, dropping
# tracked-but-not-in-base files. clean -fdxq then drops untracked AND gitignored
# cruft (secrets, runtime state). This is the ONLY correct way to get a clean

# Root-to-root contents merge. The trailing slash on the source is load-bearing:
# it merges the stage's CONTENTS into $REPO, so a path like apps/foo lands at
# apps/foo even when apps/ already exists on the base -- never nesting apps/apps.

# betterleaks.toml) over the STAGING dir. It runs TWO scanners --
# betterleaks, kingfisher (--no-validate) -- and exits non-zero on a finding
# from EITHER of them, on any scanner error, or on any missing scanner binary
# (no fallback: the binaries are baked into the workspace image, so a missing
# one is a broken environment, never a reason to scan less). A hit
# prints the offending path (value redacted, never printed) and this script
# exits 1, so the worker reports `stuck` and NOTHING is committed or pushed.
# This is the enforced gate on top of the .gitignore denylist -- not LLM
# prose.
#
# Scanning the STAGE (not the assembled tree) means the scan covers exactly
# the content overlaid out of the live mind: the selected --include /
# --data-include paths. The manifest files are generated after the scan. The
# clean base is the trusted, public default workspace template -- it cannot
# contain the user's secrets, and its own test fixtures legitimately hold
# placeholder token strings (e.g. "sk-ant-test"), so scanning it would only
# produce false positives that block every publish. The real risk is a secret
# riding in from the live mind's overlaid paths, and that is exactly what the
# stage holds. It also keeps the scan cheap regardless of how large the base
# is (never traverses vendor/, the base's fixtures, etc.). rsync -aR staged
# every file at its repo-relative path, so scan_secrets.sh's
# relative-to-scanned-dir finding paths ARE repo-root-relative.

# ${TITLE}

This file is the manifest for the **${TITLE}** template (slug:
\`${SLUG}\`). It is the one document a future agent reads to understand,
present, and adapt this template. If you are an agent in a mind that was
created from this template, this file is your script: read all of it, then
follow "How to adapt it" below.

## What it is

${manifest_description}

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with a one-paragraph overview of what this template does for its user: the
problem it solves, the main things it produces (pages, reports, automations),
and what the user sees when it is running. Write for a reader who has never
seen the original mind. -->

## How it works

The snapshot includes these paths (each is a repo-root-relative path copied
from the original mind onto a clean default-workspace-template base):

${included_paths_block}
<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with prose that makes the list above self-explanatory: for each included path,
say what it is (an app or lib with code, a skill, data) and what role it plays.
Then describe how the pieces wire together at runtime: which supervisord
programs (each in its own system/supervisord.conf.d/<name>.conf) run them,
which ports they listen on and how
those are registered in forward_port.py (if applicable), and any scripts or
services that connect them. -->

## Recipe

This template is version \`${TEMPLATE_VERSION}\`. It is not a fork of the
workspace it came from -- it is DERIVED from it by a recipe: include these
paths, leave these out, apply these published-version rules. An update re-runs
the recipe against the current workspace and publishes the result as the next
version, so anything excluded stays excluded even though it still exists in the
source workspace.

The recipe is machine-read, so it lives in the sibling
[\`${MANIFEST_TOML}\`](${MANIFEST_TOML}) -- its \`[recipe]\` table -- along with
the structured requirements and the environment this template needs
installed. That file is authoritative for all of it; this one holds the prose.

## Requirements

Everything the adopting mind must deal with before this template is really
theirs. Two kinds of entry, handled at different times:

- **Activation** -- what must be SET UP before anything runs, in the
  machine-readable \`requires_\` forms below. The adopting agent acts on these
  ITSELF, first, before asking anything.
- **Adaptation** -- what must be DECIDED or REWIRED, in prose. Worked through
  interactively with the user, after activation.

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with both kinds of entry.

ACTIVATION -- one line each, using exactly these forms (greppable by \`requires_\`):

- requires_permission: <latchkey scope> / <permission schema> (user-approved;
  the adopting agent initiates this via a latchkey permission request during
  setup -- it must not merely mention it)
- requires_secret: <ENV_VAR or config key> (what it is for and where to put it)
- requires_llm: <how the code reaches Claude, and what an adopter needs>
  (include this line whenever the app calls an LLM: name the method it was
  built for -- keyed litellm via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or keyless subscription via
  claude -p -- so an adopter on the other method knows to switch it per the
  use-ai-integration skill)

Derive the real values from the included code (e.g. every service the app
calls through \`latchkey curl\`, and whether any code calls an LLM). Example:
- requires_permission: slack-api / slack-read-all (user-approved; adopting
  agent initiates during setup)
- requires_llm: calls Claude via the keyed litellm path (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set);
  an adopter on the keyless subscription path must switch the model calls per
  use-ai-integration

These lines are what the ADOPTING agent acts on during setup, so a vague or
missing one silently breaks adoption -- a real incident: an adopter was never
prompted for a Slack permission the app needed. They are also what the lead
surfaces back to the publishing user for confirmation, so the list must be
complete and accurate. EVERY line must have its counterpart in
\`${MANIFEST_TOML}\`'s \`[requirements]\` (\`[[requirements.permission]]\`,
\`[[requirements.secret]]\`, \`[requirements.llm]\`); the validator compares
them and fails the publish if they disagree.

ADAPTATION -- one bullet each, in plain prose: every gap the adapter must
decide or rewire (stubbed integrations, hardcoded accounts/channels/ids, data
that was not included, anything that will not work out of the box). For each,
say what is missing and what a working replacement looks like. Mirror them as
\`[[requirements.adaptation]]\` entries in the TOML.

Do not repeat the README's "Ideas for making it yours" here -- those are
optional invitations, these are things that must be resolved.

If there is genuinely nothing of either kind, write exactly: "No requirements --
runs as published, with no external permissions or secrets." -->

## Environment

What this template needs INSTALLED, beyond what the template already has.
Declared in \`${MANIFEST_TOML}\`'s \`[environment]\` table; an adopting mind
converges it at ITS OWN pinned apt snapshot timestamp, so package versions come
out consistent with the rest of that mind's environment rather than frozen to
whatever this publisher happened to have.

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with a plain-language summary of what gets installed and why -- one line per
thing, naming what needs it (e.g. "poppler-utils: the digest renders PDF
attachments to text"). Fill in the matching entries in ${MANIFEST_TOML}'s
[environment] table at the same time; that table is what actually installs
anything, and this prose is what a human reads.

Derive it from the included code, not from what happens to be installed on this
machine: every binary the code shells out to, every global npm/uv/cargo tool it
invokes. If it needs nothing beyond the template's own environment, write
exactly: "Nothing extra -- runs on the stock workspace environment." -->

## How to adapt it

Instructions for the NEXT agent -- the one adapting this template into a
new mind. This is the \`use-template\` skill's template path; in short:

1. Read this entire file first, especially "Requirements" below. It holds two
   kinds of entry and they are handled at different times: the machine-readable
   \`requires_\` lines are ACTIVATION (set them up before anything runs), and
   the prose bullets are ADAPTATION (decide or rewire them afterwards).
2. Present the template to the user in plain, non-technical language: what
   it is, what it does, and what it needs from them (name the activation
   requirements).
3. Ask whether they want to use the same connectors (e.g. their own Slack).
   If YES: ACTIVATE FIRST -- initiate every \`requires_permission\` line NOW
   via a latchkey permission request (see the \`latchkey\` skill; the request
   opens the approval/login flow in the minds app), wire up any
   \`requires_secret\` values, start the services, and get the app showing
   THE USER'S OWN DATA. Done for a data-backed app means the user can open it
   and see their own data -- NOT that a service starts or an endpoint returns
   200. Then tell them it is live and to take a look.
4. Only AFTER that (or immediately, if they chose different connectors -- the
   swap is then the first adaptation) ask: "How do you want to adapt it?"
5. Work through each requirement interactively, one at a time. Translate each
   into plain language, ask for a decision only when you genuinely need one,
   and resolve the obvious ones yourself.
6. When done, append a dated entry to "Adaptation history" below (never
   rewrite earlier entries) and commit.

## Publication history

This template's changelog: what each published version changed. The PUBLISHER
appends one entry per version (newest last); earlier entries are never rewritten.
This is distinct from "Adaptation history" below, which is the ADOPTERS' log.

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment with
the first entry, in the form:
### v1 (YYYY-MM-DD) -- <one line: what this first version publishes>
using today's date. A later update of this template (the update-published-template
flow) appends "### v2 (date) -- what changed since v1", and so on. -->

## Adaptation history

Each mind that adapts this template appends one dated entry below. Earlier
entries are never rewritten.

# skill is deliberately untouched by the templates feature -- no marker
# region, no takeover branch; the template handles changing the welcome
# entirely within the snapshot it publishes. Deterministic full-file write,
# never an LLM freeform edit; idempotent across accumulated publishes (each
# publish regenerates it targeting the newly-published slug, the latest).

# Welcome the user (template: ${TITLE})

This mind was created from a template -- a published snapshot of apps
another mind built:

- Title: ${TITLE}
- Slug: \`${SLUG}\`
- Description: ${manifest_description}
- Manifest: \`${MANIFEST}\` (at the repo root, with \`${MANIFEST_TOML}\` beside it)

Do ALL of the following in your FIRST response, in the same turn, without
waiting to be asked:

1. Open with a short CUSTOM welcome that names **${TITLE}** and gives the
   one-line description above. Do NOT use a generic "Welcome to Minds"
   greeting and do NOT offer a generic suggestions list.
2. Immediately read \`${MANIFEST}\` at the repo root (reading the
   manifest in the first turn is required).
3. In plain, non-technical language, present what the template is and
   what it needs from the user -- name the manifest's activation requirements
   (the connectors/permissions it runs on). Then ask whether they want to hook it
   up to their own accounts now (e.g. "Want me to connect this to your own
   Slack?"). End your first response on THAT question. This is the
   \`use-template\` skill's template path; the manifest's "How to adapt
   it" section is the full script: if they say yes, ACTIVATE FIRST -- initiate
   each \`requires_permission\` via a latchkey permission request, get the
   app showing THEIR OWN DATA (that is the definition of working; a running
   service is not), invite them to take a look -- and only then ask how they
   want to adapt it.

This repo holds exactly one template. If \`${MANIFEST_TOML}\` lists
\`[[lineage]]\` entries, those are the templates this one was built on --
each with the repo URL and commit it was taken at, so you can go read any of
them at the exact state that was used. They are provenance, not something to
adapt here.

# --- 8.5 overwrite README.md to describe the template ---------------------

# The clean base's README describes the generic default-workspace-template.
# That is wrong for a published template: the repo's landing page -- the
# thing that decides whether a person boots this at all -- must sell THIS
# project. The structure below is the house recipe: hero graphic, the "Open in
# Minds" call-to-action, why you care, how to use it, ideas for making it
# yours. Deterministic full-file write, regenerated on every publish.
#
# The call-to-action points at the HTTPS trampoline rather than a bare
# minds:// URL, which GitHub renders dead. Both it and the copyable fallback
# need the repo URL, which does not exist yet (the repo name is confirmed in
# §6 and the owner comes back from the create call in §8), so both carry
# ${REPO_URL_PLACEHOLDER} for the lead to substitute before the push.

## Why you care

${manifest_description}

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with one or two plain sentences on the PROBLEM this solves -- why someone
would want it, not how it is built. Write for a human browsing GitHub who has
never seen the original mind. -->

## How to use it

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with how someone actually USES this once it is running: the commands,
endpoints, screens, or workflow it exposes. This is the heart of the page, so
give it the room it needs -- but default to concise and readable; a short list
or a couple of worked examples beats a wall of prose. -->

## Ideas for making it yours

<!-- FILL-IN (publishing agent): BEFORE reporting done, replace this comment
with three to five CONCRETE changes someone could make after adopting this
(e.g. "point it at a different channel", "swap the daily digest for a weekly
one", "add a second source alongside Slack"). These are optional invitations
that show the thing is a starting point -- NOT the manifest's "Requirements",
which are the things that must be resolved. Do not repeat items across the
two. -->

## What this is

This repository is a published **minds template**: a clean, bootable
snapshot of what a mind built, ready to adapt into your own. It is NOT the
generic workspace template -- it is this specific project.

[\`${MANIFEST}\`](${MANIFEST}) is the full manifest -- what it is, how it
works, what it needs to run, and what to adapt -- with the
machine-readable half (recipe, requirements, and the environment it needs
installed) in [\`${MANIFEST_TOML}\`](${MANIFEST_TOML}).

# --- 8.6 remove the version history so it never ships in a template ------

# docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md is WORKSPACE-only, never part of a template: it records
# where a mind came from and every template it has published (slugs, repo
# URLs, source commits). None of that belongs in a published template -- and
# after an update-self, BASE_REF's tree can carry an accumulated copy of it --
# so drop it from the snapshot entirely. A mind created from this template
# grows its OWN ledger when it first runs update-self or publishes (update-self
# and publish-template write the starter on demand if the file is absent), so
# nothing is lost by omitting it here. `rm -f` is safe whether or not the base
# tree carried the file. This runs AFTER the no-diff guard so it can never make
# an empty include set look like it had something to publish.

# --- 9. boot smoke-check WITHOUT side effects, then single commit -------------

# Validate system/supervisord.conf via the supervisor python lib -- realize() +
# process_config() parse and check the config WITHOUT starting the daemon.
# NEVER `supervisord -t`: in supervisord, -t means --strip_ansi and LAUNCHES the
# daemon. If the lib is unavailable, skip the check (config holes in selected
# apps are acceptable; the base booting is what matters).
#
# Run the check with the interpreter that already ships the supervisor lib --
# the one behind the installed `supervisord` binary's shebang (system python) --
# NOT `uv run`. `uv run` would resolve and BUILD the whole project environment
# (workspace sources, native wheels like line-profiler) just to import one lib:
# many seconds on a cold clean base, and it can fail outright on an unrelated
# build error, spuriously aborting a publish that is otherwise fine. Deriving
# the interpreter from the supervisord shebang keeps the check ~0.1s and robust.
