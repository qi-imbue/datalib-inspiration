"""Generate `template.toml` for a snapshot being assembled.

Called by `build_template.sh` after it has assembled the tree. Writes the
machine-readable half of the manifest: identity, the derivation recipe, and the
lineage inherited from whatever manifest this snapshot overrides.

Everything the publishing worker must still supply -- the recipe's `exclude`
and `modification_rules`, the structured `[requirements]`, and the `[environment]`
declarations -- is emitted as an empty section with a prompting comment. Those
all have empty defaults, so the generated file is valid TOML the moment it is
written and `validate_template.py` can gate on it immediately; the forcing
function for filling them in is the task instructions plus the markdown/TOML
agreement check, which fails if the worker writes a `requires_` line in
`template.md` without its counterpart here.

Pure standard library: it runs in the assembly worker's post-reset worktree,
where there is no venv, so it must work under a bare `python3`. Strings are
emitted with `json.dumps`, whose escaping is a valid subset of TOML's
basic-string escaping -- and any mistake is caught immediately, because
`build_template.sh` validates the file it just wrote.

Usage (from the assembled repo root):

    python3 write_template_manifest.py --slug S --title T --description D \\
        --version v1 --include PATH [--include PATH ...] \\
        [--data-include PATH ...] [--previous-manifest PATH] --output PATH
