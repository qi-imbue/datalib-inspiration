name: agentic-browser-fleet
description: Drive a fleet of shared Chromium browsers yourself, one command at a time, from your shell. Use when the user wants you to do something on the web (log in somewhere, fill a form, click through a flow, read a page that needs interaction) rather than just fetch a URL. YOU run the `agentic-browser-fleet` commands, look at the page, decide what to click, and click it -- in this same chat, with your own reasoning.

# Driving the browser fleet

You operate the browser by running `agentic-browser-fleet` commands directly: ask the page what's on it, decide what to do, do it, look again. Run every command from the repo root via `uv run`:

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet <command> ...
```

## First: there are no browsers until you make one

The fleet starts **empty** -- there is no default browser. Run `new` first; it prints a **name** (a random ~2-word name like `alex-smith`), and you drive that browser by its name. Browsers are addressed by name everywhere, **not by number**.

```text
uv run agentic-browser-fleet new          -> started browser alex-smith
```

(Or `new my-browser` to choose the name yourself.)

## The loop

1. `state <name>` -- prints the page as a numbered list of clickable elements.
2. Read it, decide which element you want.
3. Act: `click <name> <index>` (or `input` / `select` / `scroll` / `keys` / `open`).
4. `state <name>` again to see what changed. Repeat.

Worked end to end (after `new` printed the name `alex-smith`):

```text
uv run agentic-browser-fleet open alex-smith https://example.com      -> ok: navigate
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith
  browser alex-smith @ https://example.com/  (Example Domain)
  Example Domain
  This domain is for use in illustrative examples...
  [18]<a /> Learn more
uv run agentic-browser-fleet click alex-smith 18                      -> ok: click
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith     # re-state: page is now iana.org
  browser alex-smith @ https://www.iana.org/help/example-domains  (Example Domains)
  ...
```

Every clickable thing gets a `[number]`; that number (an element index, still a number) is what you pass to `click` / `input` / `select`. The browser argument before it is the **name**.

### Requery before you act

The `[number]` indices come from the **latest** `state` and are **ephemeral** -- the page re-numbers its elements whenever it changes. So:

- **Always `state <name>` before you `click`.**
- **Re-run `state <name>` after every `open`, `click`, `select`, `scroll`, or `tab`, and after you regain control of a browser.**

If you click against a stale index the CLI refuses rather than mis-clicking:

```text
uv run agentic-browser-fleet click alex-smith 18
  that element index is stale -- run `state alex-smith` again first      (exit 1)
```

Treat that as "look first": run `state alex-smith`, find the element under its new number, click that.

### No API key needed

`state` / `open` / `click` / `input` / `select` / `scroll` / `keys` / `screenshot` / `tab` are deterministic mechanical operations -- no LLM, no API key. (Only the optional `task` fallback at the end uses an LLM and needs a key.)

## Commands

Every command's **first argument is the browser NAME** (from `ls`, or the name `new` printed). The fleet-level commands `ls` and `new` are the exception.

### Picking and making browsers

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet ls
```

```text
browser alex-smith: you -- 2 tab(s), active: https://example.com/invoices
browser riley-jones: agent alice -- 1 tab(s), active: https://news.example.com
browser morgan-lee: human (took control) -- 1 tab(s), active: https://bank.example.com
```

`ls` shows the whole fleet: each browser's name, who controls it (`you`, `agent <name>`, `human (took control)`, or `free`), tab count, and active tab URL -- so you can pick one.

- `ls --include-tabs` lists every tab of every browser:

  ```text
      [0]* Invoices            https://example.com/invoices
      [1]  Dashboard           https://example.com/home
  ```

- `new` starts a browser with a random name and prints it (`-> started browser alex-smith`). Pass `new <name>` to choose the name yourself (e.g. `new my-browser`); a **duplicate** name is rejected (pick another -- note a *crashed* browser still holds its name until you `close` it), and an invalid name (anything other than lowercase letters/digits joined by single dashes) is rejected too. `new` returns the name **immediately**; the browser's Chromium launches in the background (serialized, so back-to-back `new`s come up one at a time). If your very next command lands while it's still launching it returns `still starting up (Chromium is launching) -- try again in a few seconds` (exit 3) -- just wait a moment and retry the same command; it is **not** an error.
- `close <name>` closes an entire browser (all its tabs) and retires its name (never reused). Use when permanently done with a browser. For a single tab, use `tab <name> close`.
- The fleet is **capped (3 by default)**. `new` past the cap returns `3/3 browsers open -- close one first` -- `release` or `close` one you're done with first.
- If there are no browsers yet, `ls` says so. There is **no default browser**: run `new` first (it prints a name), then drive by that name.

**Browsers cannot be renamed.** There is no rename command; do not try to rename a browser, and if the user asks you to, tell them it can't be done -- the only option is to `close` it and `new` one under a different name (which is a fresh browser, not the same one). A browser keeps the name it was created with for its whole life.

### Looking at the page

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith
```

Prints `browser alex-smith @ <url>  (<title>)`, a `tabs:` line if more than one tab is open, then the numbered interactive elements. A page with none prints `(no interactive elements -- try screenshot)`. This is your eyes -- run it constantly.

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet screenshot alex-smith
# -> screenshot saved: /path/to/shot.png  (Read it to view)
```

`screenshot` saves a PNG and prints its path. **Read that path** with your Read tool to see the page -- use it for visual layouts, canvas, charts, captchas, or anything `state`'s text list can't convey.

### Acting on the page

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `open <name> <url>` | Navigate the browser to a URL. (`-> ok: navigate`) |
| `click <name> <index>` | Click the element with that index from the last `state`. (`-> ok: click`) |
| `input <name> <index> "text"` | Type text into the field at that index. (`-> ok: input`) |
| `select <name> <index> "value"` | Choose an option in a `<select>` dropdown by its visible text. (`-> ok: select`) |
| `scroll <name> [down\|up] [--amount N]` | Scroll the page. Direction defaults to `down`; `--amount` is pixels (default 500). |
| `keys <name> "Enter"` | Send keyboard keys, e.g. `"Enter"`, `"Control+a"`, `"Tab"`. |

A typical fill-and-submit:

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith                          # find the field indices
uv run agentic-browser-fleet input alex-smith 5 "alice@example.com"    # email field
uv run agentic-browser-fleet input alex-smith 6 "hunter2"              # password field
uv run agentic-browser-fleet click alex-smith 7                        # the "Log in" button
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith                          # re-state: landed on the dashboard?
```

(Or `keys alex-smith "Enter"` to submit the focused form instead of clicking the button.)

### Tabs within one browser

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet tab alex-smith list           # list this browser's tabs
uv run agentic-browser-fleet tab alex-smith new --url https://example.com/help
uv run agentic-browser-fleet tab alex-smith switch 1       # make tab index 1 active
uv run agentic-browser-fleet tab alex-smith close 2        # close tab index 2
```

`tab` with no action defaults to `list`. After `switch` / `new` / `close` the active page changed, so **`state <name>` again** before clicking.

### Ownership commands

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet acquire alex-smith            # reserve browser alex-smith across commands
uv run agentic-browser-fleet acquire alex-smith --reclaim  # take it back from a human -- ONLY on their say-so
uv run agentic-browser-fleet release alex-smith            # let it go (alias: unlock alex-smith)
uv run agentic-browser-fleet handoff alex-smith "solve the CAPTCHA"  # hand to the human (alias: request-human)
```

You usually don't need `acquire`: your first command on a browser auto-acquires it and you keep a sticky lease across the commands that follow. Use `acquire` to explicitly reserve a browser, or to queue behind / reclaim one that's held. `release` (alias `unlock`) hands it back; releasing one that wasn't yours prints `browser <name> was not yours to release` and still exits `0`.

## Ownership rules

Every browser has exactly one controller; every command's output names the owner.

- **You auto-acquire and hold a sticky lease.** No manual `acquire` needed for normal driving.
- **Release when a browser leaves your active work** (`release <name>`), so control returns to the human immediately rather than after the ~90s idle timeout:
  - Task finished on that browser -> release it.
  - User tells you to stop -> release every browser you were driving.
  - You switch to a different browser for the rest of the task -> release the one you're leaving.
  - Driving several at once -> keep them until fully done, then release each.
  - If you forget, an idle lease auto-frees after ~90s; if a later command says you no longer hold it, just acquire it again.
- **The human always wins.** If a human takes control, your next command comes back with status `busy_human`/`lost_control` (exit 2). You lost control: **stop, tell the user the human took the wheel, and end your turn.** Do not retry, poll, or `--reclaim` on your own. You're queued to resume first; you'll be messaged when they hand it back. On resume, **re-run `state <name>` first** (the page changed -- and the view may have been resized while they held it, reflowing the layout, so treat every element number as stale), then continue. Resume early only on an explicit "keep going": `acquire <name> --reclaim`, then `state <name>`.
- **Agents never preempt each other.** A browser another agent holds returns (exit 3):

  ```text
  browser riley-jones is held by another agent -- you're queued for it...
  ```

  Default to a **different** browser (or `new`) for unrelated work; only `acquire riley-jones` to queue when you specifically need that browser. (Contrast with a human taking *your* browser: there your work is on it, so you wait and resume the same one.)
- **A browser can crash.** If Chromium is killed, your next command on it returns (exit 1):

  ```text
  browser alex-smith crashed (Chromium was killed -- e.g. out of memory) and is gone.
  Start a fresh one with `new` (it gets a new name).
  ```

  That browser is gone for good -- don't retry or re-`state` it; run `new` and carry on under the new name. (A crashed browser also keeps its name reserved until you `close` it, so reusing that name for `new` is rejected until then.)
- **Browsers persist across a restart** (browsers, tabs, cookies/logins/history are saved), so a site you logged into earlier is probably still logged in. Right after a restart the fleet is restoring. `new` still works during this window (it just queues behind the restore and may take a few extra seconds to come up), and `ls`/`state` work too. Only the **drive** verbs (`task`/`click`/`open`/...) on an existing browser may briefly return (exit 3):

  ```text
  the browser fleet is still starting up (restoring your saved browsers) -- try again in a few seconds.
  ```

  Wait a moment and retry.

## Hitting a wall a human must clear (CAPTCHA / 2FA / login)

When you hit a CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha / Cloudflare "verify you're human" challenge, an "I'm not a robot" checkbox, an SMS / 2FA / OTP code you don't have, or a login needing the user's own credentials -- **do not try to solve it yourself** (you'll fail and may get the account flagged). Hand it off:

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet handoff alex-smith "solve the CAPTCHA on the sign-in page"
```

`handoff` (alias `request-human`) puts you at the **front** of that browser's resume queue, hands control to the human (pinned -- won't pass to another agent), and surfaces the pane so they can see it. In the **same turn**: tell the user exactly what to do and on which page, then **end your turn** (exit 2). You're woken first when they hand control back -- **re-run `state alex-smith`** to confirm the challenge cleared, then carry on.

## Live view vs. your output

The browser streams to a UI pane next to your chat. `new`/`task`/your first command surface it automatically -- **but only when the user is currently watching your chat** (it lands beside that chat on their active layout). So don't manage panes yourself: never open a bare `service:browser` (no browser bound -- the daemon rejects it). If the user explicitly asks you to open a browser that isn't showing, run `layout.py open service:browser?session=<name>` **with the name**; otherwise just tell them to open it from the workspace **+ -> browser** menu -- don't fuss over it.

The pane is **viewer only** -- your real output (`state` listings, `ok:`/error lines, screenshot paths) is here in the CLI. Read and relay that; don't tell the user to "check the tab" for results.

## Multiple browsers, tabs, sub-agents

- **Multiple browsers:** `new` each one (each prints its own name); they're independent and don't queue against each other. Drive several at once just by varying the name.
- **Tabs:** `tab <name> ...` manages tabs within one browser.
- **Drive the browser yourself, here in this chat.** A `launch-task` sub-agent runs in a separate, isolated container with no access to this workspace's browser fleet, so do web/browser work yourself. If a sub-agent needs something from the web, have it tell you what it needs and you do the browsing. (A parent passing its chat to a sub-agent can set `BROWSER_FLEET_ANCHOR` so panes anchor to that chat, but the daemon/fleet still isn't reachable from an isolated sub-agent.)

## Exit codes -- branch on these

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | ok | Read the output; for `state`, decide your next action. |
| `1` | error / stale index / crashed browser | Stale index: `state <name>`, find the new number, retry. Crashed: `new`. Else read the message. |
| `2` | preempted (human took control, or you ran `handoff`) | **Stop and end your turn.** Tell the user; you'll be messaged to resume (re-run `state <name>` first). Don't poll or `--reclaim` on your own. |
| `3` | busy (another agent holds it, or fleet full / still restoring / the browser is still launching) | Use a different browser (or `new`); you're queued and will be messaged when it frees. For "restoring" or "still starting up (Chromium is launching)", wait a few seconds and retry the SAME command (a freshly `new`ed browser launches in the background). |
| `4` | timed out (waited via `--max-wait` and another agent still held it) | Try later, or pick a different browser. |
| `64` | usage (`MNGR_AGENT_ID` unset / bad arguments / invalid `new <name>`) | Run from inside an agent shell; fix the command (for an invalid name, pick a valid one). |
| `69` | no daemon (can't reach the browser service) | The service isn't running -- report it; don't blindly retry. |

# Make a browser, then look and act (assume `new` printed `alex-smith`).
uv run agentic-browser-fleet new
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith
uv run agentic-browser-fleet click alex-smith 12
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith            # always re-state after acting

# Read a page by eye when the text list isn't enough.
uv run agentic-browser-fleet open alex-smith https://example.com/pricing
uv run agentic-browser-fleet screenshot alex-smith       # then Read the printed PNG path

# Search and submit with the keyboard.
uv run agentic-browser-fleet open alex-smith https://news.ycombinator.com
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith
uv run agentic-browser-fleet input alex-smith 3 "browser automation"
uv run agentic-browser-fleet keys alex-smith "Enter"
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith

# Two browsers, independently (no queueing -- different names).
uv run agentic-browser-fleet new                          # -> started browser alex-smith
uv run agentic-browser-fleet new                          # -> started browser riley-jones
uv run agentic-browser-fleet open alex-smith https://site-a.com
uv run agentic-browser-fleet open riley-jones https://site-b.com

# Hit a CAPTCHA -- hand it to the user, then STOP.
uv run agentic-browser-fleet handoff alex-smith "solve the CAPTCHA on the sign-in page"
# -> tell the user what to do, end your turn; you resume first when they hand back.
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state alex-smith            # (on resume) confirm the challenge cleared

# Human took over, then said "keep going" -- and ONLY then:
uv run agentic-browser-fleet acquire riley-jones --reclaim
uv run agentic-browser-fleet state riley-jones            # re-state after regaining control
```

## Fallback only: `task <name> "<goal>"`

When a page is genuinely beyond step-by-step control -- a `<canvas>` app, a drag-heavy visual editor, a flow where `state` shows nothing useful even with a screenshot -- you can hand the whole goal to an autonomous browser-use agent instead of driving it yourself:

```bash
uv run agentic-browser-fleet task alex-smith "log into example.com and download last month's invoice"
```

This streams the agent's `[thinking]`/`[action]` trace into your output and ends with a `done:` line you relay. It **uses an LLM and needs an API key**, and it takes the wheel away from your direct control for its duration. Flags: `--reclaim` (resume a human-held browser, same rules as above), `--no-wait` (fail fast instead of queueing behind another agent), `--max-wait S` (bound the queue wait, then exit `4`), `--no-pane` (don't pull it into a UI pane). **Prefer driving it yourself** -- reach for `task` only when direct control truly can't see or manipulate the page.

## Don'ts

- Don't `click <index>` without a fresh `state` first -- indices go stale the moment the page changes.
- Don't "take control" -- that's a human-only UI action. You drive by issuing commands.
- Don't pass `--reclaim` unless the human explicitly told you to resume a browser they took over.
- Don't auto-retry on exit `2` (preempted). Stop and wait for the human.
- Don't tell the user to "look in the tab" for results -- your CLI output is the source of truth; the tab is just the live picture.
- Don't jump to `task` for ordinary pages. Drive them yourself.
- **Don't try to rename a browser.** There is no rename command and a browser's name is fixed for its whole life. If the user asks you to rename one, tell them it can't be done -- the only option is to `close` it and `new` one under a different name (a fresh browser, not the same one).
- Don't assume a default browser exists. The fleet starts empty -- run `new` first, then drive by the name it prints.
