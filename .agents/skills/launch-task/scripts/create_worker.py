"""Worker-creation driver for the launch-task family of skills.

Five subcommands cover the lead-side lifecycle:

``launch``
    Runs the worker-creation lifecycle synchronously (``mngr create`` + the
    runtime-dir sync + the task message) and returns. Callers run this in the
    *foreground* so a failed launch surfaces immediately rather than as a
    delayed background notification.

``await``
    Reads the ``finish_report_path`` field from the task file's frontmatter and
    blocks until that file appears, prints its contents to stdout, and returns
    0. On timeout it returns non-zero so the caller drops into the liveness
    diagnosis described in ``.agents/shared/references/lead-proxy.md``. Callers
    run this in the *background* and re-invoke it once per gate cycle; it is
    deliberately dumb -- it only waits and cats. Parsing the report, deciding
    answer-vs-escalate, consuming the report into ``consumed/``, and merging are
    all lead judgment and stay in ``lead-proxy.md``.

``launch-sync``
    The blocking one-call path for non-interactive callers (services): launch,
    wait for the report in the *foreground*, emit a structured-result JSON
    object (``timed_out`` plus the report ``type``/``name``/``body`` and the
    worker ``branch``), and destroy the worker. ``--result-json`` also writes
    that JSON to a caller-named file as the machine-readable contract.
    ``--keep-agent`` skips the destroy; a timeout never destroys (the report may
    still be coming).

``reply``
    Sends the lead's answer to a worker's gate (or any nudge) to the worker's
    chat, through the chat app (``system/scripts/message_chat.py``), addressed
    by the ``worker_agent_id`` that ``launch`` stamped into the task file. A
    task file from before that stamp is reached by ``mngr message <name>``
    instead, with the worker's name given through ``reply --name``.

``destroy``
    Destroys the worker agent (``mngr destroy <name> --force``). The git branch
    ``mngr/<name>`` survives in the shared object store, so the work can still
    be merged or inspected.

The ``launch`` / ``await`` / ``launch-sync`` subcommands take the same
``--task-file``: ``launch`` sends it to the worker, and ``await`` /
``launch-sync`` read its ``finish_report_path`` to learn what to wait for.
Putting the wait target in frontmatter (rather than deriving a fixed path) keeps
the contract data-driven, so future flows can point the wait at a different
report without a code change.

The caller is responsible for writing the task file (with whatever YAML
frontmatter the worker template requires) and for placing it -- and any
gitignored auxiliary state -- under ``data/.tasks/<feature>/<slug>/`` before
calling ``launch``. This script orchestrates the lifecycle commands; it does
not compose task content.

Ticket bookkeeping (``tk create`` / ``tk start`` / ``tk close``) is the
caller's responsibility -- it lives in the calling skill's prose so each
flow can shape the ticket title, type, and acceptance criteria itself.

When the worker needs gitignored auxiliary state (scripts, sample data)
that lives outside the runtime dir, the caller declares it in the task
frontmatter with a ``source_artifacts_dir`` key; launch reads that key
and syncs the directory alongside the runtime dir -- no extra CLI flag.

Launch lifecycle commands:

    mngr create <NAME> -t <TEMPLATE> --format jsonl   (its ``created`` event names the worker's id)
    mngr rsync  ./<RUNTIME_DIR>/   <NAME>:<RUNTIME_DIR>/   --uncommitted-changes=merge
    mngr rsync  ./<ARTIFACTS_DIR>/ <NAME>:<ARTIFACTS_DIR>/ --uncommitted-changes=merge
                (when frontmatter declares it)
    python3 system/scripts/message_chat.py <WORKER_ID> --message-file <TASK_FILE>

The task message goes through the chat app by the worker's id rather than
through ``mngr message`` by its name: a chat is addressed by id (a rename
changes the name; see ``docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/``), and the
script falls back to ``mngr message`` itself when the chat app cannot take the
message. The id is read back from the create's ``created`` event and stamped
into the task frontmatter as ``worker_agent_id`` so ``reply`` can address the
worker later without a lookup.

``mngr rsync`` takes ``SOURCE DESTINATION`` (the local source dir first, then
the ``<NAME>:<PATH>`` agent endpoint). The trailing slash on both ends makes
rsync copy directory *contents* into the destination. The local source is
``./``-prefixed so mngr reads it as a path rather than an agent name, while the
agent destination stays repo-relative so mngr resolves it against the worker's
workdir. The ``--uncommitted-changes=merge`` flag is required (see
``.agents/shared/references/lead-proxy.md``).

Why the task message goes *after* the syncs (instead of using ``mngr create
--message-file``): if the worker reads its first message before the runtime
dir sync lands in its worktree, the task file's ``finish_report_path`` will
resolve to nothing. Sending the task as a follow-up message guarantees the
worker sees the runtime dir first.

Common-transcript flush: right before sending the task message we invoke the
lead's own ``common_transcript.sh --single-pass`` converter (when present).
This guarantees the worker's first ``mngr transcript <lead>`` read includes
every turn up through the handoff -- the converter normally polls on a 5s
interval, which races with worker startup. It only freshens through the
handoff moment; later lead turns won't appear until the poller catches up,
which is fine for the anchored-lookup pattern (workers locate quotes the
lead already pasted into the task body).

    When ``MNGR_AGENT_ID`` is unset -- i.e. ``launch`` is running outside an
