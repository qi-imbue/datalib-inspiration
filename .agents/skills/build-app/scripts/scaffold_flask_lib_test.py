"""What the scaffolder writes -- and, just as importantly, what it leaves alone.

A scaffold's whole footprint has to be files only it owns, so that two agents can
build two creations in one workspace at the same time. That is a property of the
files the script touches, not of the lib it generates, so these run the real script
over a real (temporary) workspace and assert on the tree it leaves behind.

The port pre-flight is checked the same way: every program declares its port in
its own drop-in now, so a pre-flight that read only the main config would hand a
new app a port another program already holds.
