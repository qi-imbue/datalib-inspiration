# Service process mechanics (supervisord)

Shared reference for the supervisord layer beneath a service -- its
`[program:<name>]` definition, and how to add, remove, modify, or inspect a
program. Reach for this from any service flow (`update-app`,
`build-app`) when a change touches *how a service runs* (its port,
command, logs) or adds/removes a program, rather than only its code.

Background services are defined as `[program:<name>]` sections in
`system/supervisord.conf` at the repo root. `uv run bootstrap` runs first-boot
setup and then `exec`s `supervisord` in the foreground (in the `bootstrap`
tmux window); supervisord starts and supervises every program. supervisord
does **not** watch the config file -- you apply changes with
`supervisorctl`.

## Program format

```ini
[program:my-service]
command=python3 system/services/oom_priority/bin/oom_tag_service.py user uv run my-service
directory=/home/user/workspace
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=1000000
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/my-service-stdout.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/my-service-stderr.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stdout_logfile_backups=3
stderr_logfile_backups=3
```

Key fields:

- `command` -- the program to run. **supervisord exec's this directly (no
  shell)**, so anything that chains with `&&`, sets an inline env var, or uses
  other shell syntax must be wrapped in `bash -c "..."`:

  ```ini
  command=python3 system/services/oom_priority/bin/oom_tag_service.py user bash -c "python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --url http://localhost:8090 --name foo && uv run foo"
  ```

  The `python3 system/services/oom_priority/bin/oom_tag_service.py user` prefix is the **OOM band tag**
  (see below) -- keep it as the outermost command, in front of any `bash -c`
  wrapper.
- `directory=/home/user/workspace` -- run from the repo root, so cwd-relative paths
  (`data/...`, `system/scripts/...`) resolve. Set this on every program.
- `autostart=true` -- start when supervisord boots.
- `autorestart=true` -- restart a long-lived daemon whenever it exits. (This is
  the replacement for the old `restart = "on-failure"`; the standard daemons all
  use `true`.) For a **one-shot** task that should run once and then stay
  stopped, use `autorestart=false` plus `startsecs=0` and `exitcodes=0` (see the
  `deferred-install` program for an example).
- `stopasgroup=true` / `killasgroup=true` -- signal the whole `bash -c` process
  group on stop, so a wrapped command shuts down cleanly.
- `stdout_logfile` / `stderr_logfile` (+ `*_maxbytes` / `*_backups`) --
  separate, rotated, container-local logs under `/var/log/supervisor/`. These
  are **not** under `data/`, so they are not backed up. If you omit them,
  supervisord writes AUTO logs into its `childlogdir` (`/var/log/supervisor`)
  instead.

Services inherit the agent environment (`MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR`,
`MNGR_HOST_DIR`, `LATCHKEY_*`, ...) from the bootstrap shell
that launched supervisord -- you do not need a per-program `environment=`.
(`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is deliberately NOT in that environment: every claude
in the workspace uses claude's own default `~/.claude`.)

## OOM priority (memory-pressure shedding)

A background `earlyoom` daemon sheds processes when the container runs low on
memory, most-expendable first (see `system/services/oom_priority/README.md`). Prefix every
service `command` with `python3 system/services/oom_priority/bin/oom_tag_service.py user` so a
**user-created** service is shed *before* any built-in service (the UI, tunnel,
terminal, backups) under memory pressure -- those are the workspace's lifelines
and should outlive a service you added. The wrapper sets the process's
`oom_score_adj` and then `exec`s your real command, so it adds no runtime
overhead.

Only the built-in template services pass their own name instead of `user` (e.g.
`... oom_tag_service.py system_interface ...`); anything you add should use
`user`. There is no protected escape hatch: an unknown key defaults to the
`user` band, and if you omit the prefix entirely a backstop listener
(`oom-tag-backstop`) tags the service into the `user` band shortly after it
starts anyway. Still include the prefix -- it applies the band at spawn rather
than ~1s later, and it keeps the command self-documenting.

## Adding a service

1. Add a new `[program:<name>]` section to `system/supervisord.conf`.
2. Apply it:

   ```bash
   supervisorctl reread && supervisorctl update
   ```

   `reread` re-parses the config; `update` starts newly-added programs, stops
   removed ones, and restarts changed ones.
3. Confirm it is running: `supervisorctl status <name>`.

## Removing a service

1. Delete the `[program:<name>]` section from `system/supervisord.conf`.
2. `supervisorctl reread && supervisorctl update` -- supervisord stops and
   forgets the removed program.

For an app, also drop its `data/.state/apps.toml` entry with
`python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --name <name> --remove`; for a scaffolded
web lib, `build-app`'s `cleanup.md` reference covers the full
teardown (reverting the lib and the root `pyproject.toml` edits).

## Modifying a service

1. Change the program's `command` (or other fields) in `system/supervisord.conf`.
2. `supervisorctl reread && supervisorctl update` applies the change (it
   restarts the program when its definition changed). To bounce a program
   without editing its config, use `supervisorctl restart <name>`.

## Inspecting services

```bash
supervisorctl status                 # all programs + states
supervisorctl status <name>          # one program
supervisorctl tail -f <name> stderr  # follow a program's stderr log
```

Or read the log files directly under `/var/log/supervisor/`.

## Important

- Program names must be valid supervisord program names (no spaces).
- supervisord only manages the programs in `system/supervisord.conf`; it does not touch
  the main agent window or other tmux windows.
- If you need a one-off command, just run it directly rather than adding a
  program.
- For standing up a new app (Flask lib or wrapping a third-party
  server), use the `build-app` skill -- it generates the `[program:*]`
  block and `forward_port.py` wiring for you.
