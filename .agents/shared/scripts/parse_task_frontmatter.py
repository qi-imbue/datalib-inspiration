"""Parse a worker task file's YAML frontmatter and emit its string fields.

Pins the required schema so workers can't silently consume a task file
whose `finish_report_path` was missing, misspelled, or the wrong type.
`lead_agent` is the dispatching agent's mngr id (an `agent-<hex>` value; older
launchers stamped the lead's name, which a rename invalidates), normally
stamped by `create_worker.py launch`; it is deliberately OPTIONAL here (absent
-> warn on stderr, emit no line) because a task file can be authored by a
*newer* flow than the launcher that provisioned the worker (update-self stages
the target version's prose for an older lead), and a worker that finished its
task must never be structurally unable to say so -- the delivery in
`worker-reporting.md` is a write into the lead's work dir, falling back to
the repo's main worktree. Beyond those, any additional top-level
string fields the lead sets are passed through to the worker -- so leads
can attach flow-specific context (a ticket id, a feature flag, a list of
staged inputs) without each new key requiring a parser change. The launcher's
`lead_work_dir` stamp (the lead's own checkout) reaches the worker that way,
as `LEAD_WORK_DIR`, and is absent from the output when it was not stamped.

The positional argument is a path that may contain a shell-style glob
(e.g. ``data/.tasks/harden/*/task.md``). The helper resolves the
glob itself and fails loudly if zero or multiple files match -- so a
worker whose runtime layout drifts (missing task file, or two copies
landing in the same tree) cannot silently parse the wrong thing.
Quote the pattern in the shell (``'data/.tasks/harden/*/task.md'``)
so the literal glob reaches this script.

On success (exit 0) prints shell-evalable ``KEY=value`` lines to
stdout (values quoted via ``shlex.quote`` so whitespace and shell
metacharacters survive). The required fields come first in fixed
order; any extra string fields follow alphabetically:

    LEAD_AGENT=agent-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
    FINISH_REPORT_PATH=data/.tasks/harden/update-foo/reports/report.md
    TICKET_ID=task-42

Non-string frontmatter values (lists, mappings, numbers, bools) are
silently dropped -- only strings round-trip cleanly through ``eval``.
Extra string keys must be valid POSIX shell identifiers (so the
``KEY=value`` line a downstream ``eval`` consumes actually creates a
variable instead of being parsed as a command). A key like
``staged-inputs`` fails loud rather than silently disappearing.

On any failure -- no glob match, multiple glob matches, file missing,
no/broken frontmatter, any required field missing, wrong type, empty
string, or an extra key that isn't a valid shell identifier -- prints a
human-readable error to stderr and exits 1.
