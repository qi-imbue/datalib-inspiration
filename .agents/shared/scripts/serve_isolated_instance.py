"""Spin up an isolated, throwaway instance of a service on a spare port.

This is the shared substrate under two service flows:

- ``update-app`` boots a copy of a service against a *copy* of its data
  (``DATA_DIR`` pointed at a scratch dir) so an edit can be exercised -- writes,
  deletes, migrations -- without ever touching the user's live store. The agent
  reaches the instance directly on its loopback port.
- ``update-system-interface`` boots the worker's already-built work_dir as a
  *preview* the user clicks around before a change is merged.

Both are the same motion: launch the service on a free port, with environment
overrides that isolate its writable state, wait until it is healthy, and
(optionally) surface it to the user as a labeled "preview" tab. The only thing
that differs is *what* is launched and *how* its state is isolated -- so this
script is deliberately unopinionated and takes all of that as parameters. The
calling skill supplies the specifics.

The two shapes:

- **Bare instance (own testing).** Given just ``--name``, ``--cwd``,
  ``--port-env`` and the launch argv, it picks a free port, injects it into the
  named env var, boots the service, waits for health, and prints the loopback URL
  to stdout. Nothing is registered with the workspace UI; the agent curls /
  drives the port directly. ``down`` kills it.
- **Preview (surface to the user).** Add ``--service-name`` to also register the
  instance as a proxied service, and ``--preview-service-name`` + ``--preview-title``
  to wrap it in a labeled "preview" frame (``preview_wrapper_server.py``) the user
  opens as a tab. ``down`` kills both servers and deregisters both services.

The service must read its port (and, when relevant, its data dir) from the
environment -- that is what ``--port-env`` / ``--env`` inject. Scaffolded Flask
services do this out of the box (``<PKG>_PORT`` / ``<PKG>_DATA_DIR``); an older
service is retrofitted with the same one-liner when it is edited.

Run via bare ``python3`` (standard library only) -- like ``forward_port.py`` and
``reveal_system_interface.py``, it orchestrates the environment, so it must not
depend on any particular venv being synced.

Usage:
    python3 serve_isolated_instance.py up --name <slug> --cwd <dir> \\
        --port-env <ENVVAR> [--host-env <ENVVAR>] \\
        [--env NAME=VALUE ...] [--unset-env NAME ...] [--health-path /path] \\
        [--service-name <name>] \\
        [--preview-service-name <name> --preview-title <label>] \\
        [--repo-root PATH] -- <launch argv...>
    python3 serve_isolated_instance.py down --name <slug> [--repo-root PATH]

Exit codes:
    0  Success (instance is up and healthy / torn down).
    1  Failure to boot (partial state torn down), or a bad argument / unreadable
       state file.
