# app_instances

The shared implementation of the instances API every multi-instance workspace
app serves (`contracts.md` sections 4 and 5 of the workspace app model, in
`docs/system/blueprint/workspace-app-model/`): the Flask blueprint over a
pluggable instance source, a JSON store for apps whose instances have no other
backing state, the nudge that tells the shell a list changed, and a sidecar
launcher that wraps a third-party server. A user who wants two dashboards side
by side pays nothing new: mount the blueprint over a source, or let the sidecar
serve it beside the wrapped server.

The shell is the only caller of the API, over loopback, at the registry row's
`instances_url`. Browsers never reach it; the shell relays every instance verb.

## API

- `app_instances.blueprint`: `build_instances_blueprint(source, nudger)` serves
  exactly `GET /_instances`, `POST /_instances` (201), `DELETE /_instances/<key>`
  (204, idempotent), `POST /_instances/<key>/rename`,
  `POST /_instances/<key>/location`, `POST /_instances/<key>/stop`, and
  `POST /_instances/<key>/start` (both `200 {"instance": record}`, idempotent).
  Every mutating route calls the source, then
  `nudger.nudge()`, then answers; reads never nudge. A key that fails the key
  rule, a body that is not the route's shape, `UnknownActionError`,
  `InvalidParamsError`, `NotRenameableError`, `NotStoppableError`, and
  `LocationNotTrackedError` are
  `400`; `UnknownInstanceError` is `404`; `InstanceConflictError` is `409`;
  `NotReadyError` is `503`; any other library error is `500`. Every error body
  is `{"detail": "<message>"}`. Bodies are read with `force=True`, so a caller
  need not send a JSON content type. The two halves of that are public for an
  app that serves routes of its own beside the blueprint (the terminal's hook
  route): `parse_request_body(model)` reads the current request's body as
  `model` (raising `MalformedRequestError`, a `400`), and `answer_typed_error`
  is the `AppInstancesError` handler to register on the app's own blueprint, so
  its routes answer the app's errors (subclasses of the library's) the same
  way. `build_instances_app(source, nudger)` is a Flask app that serves
  nothing but the blueprint, which is what the sidecar and the stub app run.
- `app_instances.interfaces`: `InstanceSourceInterface` (`list_instances`,
  `create_instance(action, params)`, `delete_instance(key)`,
  `rename_instance(key, title)`, `set_location(key, path)`, and the
  non-abstract `stop_instance(key)` and `start_instance(key)`, which default
  to raising `NotStoppableError` so a source whose instances have nothing to
  stop need not mention them; a source that lists a `stoppable` record
  overrides both. Implementations
  must be thread-safe, the API is served threaded) and
  `InstanceNudgerInterface` (`nudge()`).
- `app_instances.data_types`: `InstanceStatus` (`working`, `idle`,
  `attention`, `stopped`, `error`), `InstanceLifetime` (`explicit`,
  `referenced`), `InstanceRecord` (the wire record; `model_dump(mode="json")`
  is what the API emits, with `last_active` anchored to UTC; `stoppable`
  defaults to false), and the request
  bodies `CreateRequest`, `RenameRequest`, `LocationRequest`.
- `app_instances.primitives`: `InstanceKey` (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$`),
  `InstanceKeyPrefix`, `InstanceUrl` (rooted with a single slash, at most 2048
  characters, no control characters, `{tab}` at most once), `LocationPath` (the
  same without the placeholder), `AbsoluteHttpUrl` (an absolute `http(s)` URL
  with a host, under the same length and character rules) and `LocationTarget`,
  the union a location report carries (a source takes the form that fits it:
  the JSON store records paths and answers `400` for a URL; the browser
  navigates to a URL), `InstanceTitle` (non-blank, trimmed, at most
  256 characters), `TitleTemplate` (must contain `{n}`),
  `render_title_template(template, number)`, which fills the placeholder in,
  and the workspace's naming rule as the chat app applies it to chats:
  `canonical_name_from_title` ("My Build" to "My-Build"; "" when nothing
  usable remains) and `is_name_conflict(candidate_title, taken_names)`
  (canonical forms compared case-insensitively), for an app whose keys are
  the true names of user-typed titles (the terminal).
- `app_instances.json_store`: `JsonStoreInstanceSource` keeps records in one
  `instances.json` (`{"version": 1, "instances": [record, ...]}`), rewritten
  atomically (temp file plus rename) under the source's own lock, so one source
  per process must be the file's only writer; a stray temp file from a crashed
  write is ignored. Its one action is `new`, which mints the lowest free
  `<key_prefix>-<N>` (a deleted number is reused) and stores `params.path`
  (default `/`) as the URL; a location report replaces the URL and refreshes
  `last_active`. `key_prefix`, `title_template`, `lifetime`, `is_renameable`,
  and `is_location_tracked` are constructor fields. `app_store_path(name)` is
  the conventional `data/.apps/<name>/instances.json`; `allocate_key(prefix,
  taken_keys)` (or `allocate_instance_number` plus `allocated_key`, when the
  number itself is wanted) and `instance_number(prefix, key)` are the
  allocator, for sources that keep their own record of keys.
  `read_json_document(path, model)` (None for a missing file; a file that
  cannot be read, is not JSON, or does not fit raises `InstanceStoreError`)
  and `write_json_document(path, document)` (the atomic replace) are the
  store's file handling, for an app that keeps a document shape of its own.
- `app_instances.nudge`: `post_to_shell(url, body)` is every post an app
  makes to the shell: JSON body (or none) with a two-second timeout, an
  unreachable or refusing shell logged at debug level, a warning when the post
  took over half a second. `ShellNudger(app_name, shell_url)` posts
  `POST <shell>/api/apps/<name>/changed` through it; an app's own posts to the
  shell's tab routes (the terminal's) go through it too. `ThreadedNudger(inner)`
  hands each nudge to a daemon thread, for an app whose list changes on a thread
  that must not wait on the shell (the browser's event loop); `SilentNudger`
  nudges nobody (the default before an app installs its shell nudger, and for
  tests). `shell_base_url()`
  resolves the shell exactly as `system/scripts/layout.py` does
  (`MINDS_WORKSPACE_SERVER_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
- `app_instances.sidecar`: `app_url_port(app_url)` is the port the wrapped
  server must listen on (the app URL's; a `SidecarError` when it names none).
  `run_sidecar(manifest_path, app_url, instances_url,
  child_argv, source)` starts the blueprint at `instances_url` on a daemon
  thread (werkzeug's threaded server), registers the app by running
  `system/scripts/forward_port.py --manifest <path> --url <app_url>` under its
  own interpreter (after the listener is up, so the shell's first fetch
  succeeds), spawns the
  child, forwards `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` to it, and returns the exit status to
  end the program with: the child's code, or 128 plus the signal number when a
  signal killed it. It must run on the main thread and from the repo root
  (the registration script and the registry are cwd-relative, like everything
  supervisord runs). The manifest must declare `instances = true` with an
  `instances_url` equal to the one served. `run_sidecar_app(manifest_path,
  app_url, instances_url, child_argv, build_app)` is the same with the Flask
  app built by `build_app(manifest, nudger)`, for an app that mounts routes of
  its own beside the blueprint (the terminal's hook route); `run_sidecar` wraps
  it. `serve_in_background(host, port,
  app)` is the context manager it serves through (bind, daemon thread, shut
  down on exit), which tests reuse for scratch servers.
- `app_instances.testing`: `StubInstanceSource` (in-memory, records every
  call), `RecordingNudger`, `free_port`, `is_port_accepting`, `wait_until`,
  `write_sidecar_manifest` (a valid multi-instance `app.toml` plus its icon),
  `SidecarEnvironment` (the scratch directory and registry a sidecar test runs
  against) and `prepare_sidecar_environment(tmp_path, monkeypatch, repo_root)`,
  which builds one for a fixture (cwd at the repo root, the registry and an
  unreachable shell in the environment), `serve_recording_shell()` (a fake
  shell that records every request's method, path, and JSON body and answers
  `404`), and `run_stub_app(port)` for the shell's tests; as a
  module it serves the stub app (`python -m app_instances.testing stub --port
  <port>`) or runs the sidecar over a JSON store (`... sidecar --manifest ...
  --app-url ... --instances-url ... --store ... -- <child argv>`).

The terminal, files (the sidecar around dufs), browser, and chat apps are its
users.
