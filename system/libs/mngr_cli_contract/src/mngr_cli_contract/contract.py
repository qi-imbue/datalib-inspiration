"""Validate that a ``mngr <subcommand> ...`` argv is accepted by the *live* mngr CLI.

Repo code shells out to the ``mngr`` CLI by constructing argvs. A test that
pins such an argv against a *hand-written expected argv* (via a stubbed
subprocess runner) only confirms "the code emits the bytes we told it to
emit" -- the expected argv is authored from the same assumption as the
production code, so the two drift together and the test can never notice when
system/vendor/mngr renames or removes the subcommand or one of its flags. That
divergence then surfaces only at runtime.

``assert_mngr_argv_valid`` closes that gap by resolving the argv against the
actual ``imbue.mngr.main.cli`` click command tree. It checks *shape* only --
the subcommand must exist and every option token must be recognized -- using
click's low-level ``OptionParser`` so value validators (``Path(exists=True)``,
callbacks, type coercion, required-option enforcement) do NOT run. We are
verifying the CLI surface the repo depends on, not the runtime values a
particular invocation carries.

``-S KEY=VALUE`` config overrides are the one exception to the shape-only rule:
click sees an opaque string there, but mngr resolves the key path against its
config model at startup and hard-fails the command when it does not exist. Those
are checked too, through mngr's own resolution (see ``assert_mngr_settings_valid``).

This lives in its own workspace package so both repo-side pytest passes (the
root pass and the isolated system/apps/system_interface pass, which share one
workspace venv) import a single copy rather than duplicating the validator.
