"""Bootstrap: first-boot setup, then launch supervisord.

`uv run bootstrap` runs once per container boot (from the `bootstrap`
extra_window). It performs first-boot setup -- global git config and creating
the initial chat agent -- and then `exec`s the system supervisord in the
foreground. supervisord (configured by system/supervisord.conf) owns every
background service from then on.

Running supervisord via exec keeps the bootstrap tmux window alive as
supervisord and lets the supervised services inherit this shell's already-
sourced agent environment (MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR, MNGR_HOST_DIR, etc.).
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is deliberately absent from that environment: every claude
in the workspace uses claude's own default ~/.claude, so there is nothing to
resolve or export.

    Written here, at every boot, rather than once by ``setup_system.sh``:
    /etc/cron.d lives on the container rootfs, so an entry laid down at
    provision time is gone the moment the container is recreated -- and this
    guard is the only thing that recovers an apply killed hard WITHOUT a
    restart, whose driving agent is also gone. Writing it from the one place
    that already knows where the script lives also keeps the path from being
    spelled out a second time.

    Code-owned, so it goes straight to ``target_dir`` rather than into the
    user-editable ``RUNTIME_CRON_DIR``. It is written before those entries are
    installed, so a deliberate same-named entry there still wins.

    Two details are load-bearing rather than boilerplate. cron does NOT inherit
    the image's PATH; a drop-in gets cron's compiled-in ``/usr/bin:/bin``, and
    when this guard acts it takes ``recover``'s live path, which shells out to
    ``mngr`` and ``uv`` (/root/.local/bin) and ``npm`` (/usr/local/bin) -- a
    FileNotFoundError there is swallowed, so without the PATH line the tree
    would be rolled back and the live workspace silently left broken. And
    ``flock -n`` keeps two ticks off one git index: an acting tick rebuilds
    environments, re-runs the provisioner and waits out health probes,
    routinely longer than the five minutes until the next one, and ``--if-stale``
    reads the dead apply's pid from a marker ``recover`` never restamps, so
    nothing else would stop them overlapping.

    This is also the one cron entry that deliberately does NOT go through
    ``system/libs/automations/with_agent_env.sh`` (which every other job,
    built-in or user-added, is required to use, and which would supply that
    PATH and cwd for free). The wrapper reconstructs the agent environment by
    sourcing ``/home/user/.mngr/env`` and parsing the host dir with ``jq``, and
    exits non-zero when either is missing -- and a workspace left mid-apply is
    exactly where that assumption is least safe. The guard needs no agent
    environment beyond PATH: everything it shells out to resolves from ``$HOME``
    (which is ``/home/user`` for root here, so mngr finds its host dir), so it
    carries its own two lines instead and keeps working when the wrapper would
    not.
