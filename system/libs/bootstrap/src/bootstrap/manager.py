"""Bootstrap: first-boot setup, then launch supervisord.

`uv run bootstrap` runs once per container boot (from the `bootstrap`
extra_window). It performs first-boot setup -- global git config and creating
the initial chat agent -- and then `exec`s the system supervisord in the
foreground. supervisord (configured by system/supervisord.conf) owns every
background service from then on.

Running supervisord via exec keeps the bootstrap tmux window alive as
supervisord and lets the supervised services inherit this shell's already-
sourced agent environment (MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR, MNGR_HOST_DIR, etc.).
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is deliberately absent from that environment: every claude
in the workspace uses claude's own default ~/.claude, so there is nothing to
resolve or export.
