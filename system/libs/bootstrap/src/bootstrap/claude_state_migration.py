"""Migrate claude state left under a legacy /root home into the current home tree.

Workspaces created before the /home/user home layout (pre-minds-v0.3.16 lima
and modal creates) ran every process with HOME=/root, so claude's state --
session transcripts, sign-in credentials, settings, plugins, and the global
``.claude.json`` -- accumulated under ``/root/.claude`` (plus
``/root/.claude.json`` beside it). Updating such a workspace repoints root's
home at the persistent /home/user tree (the same passwd edit fresh creates
apply at provision time), after which every claude resolves ``~/.claude`` to
``/home/user/.claude`` -- a freshly created, empty directory. Nothing is
deleted, but the workspace looks wiped: no chat history, and a sign-in prompt.

The migration runs on every bootstrap (see ``manager.main``), which covers
both moments that matter: the service restart that applies an update-self
pass, and any later boot of a workspace an earlier update already stranded.
It fires only when the resolved home is not /root, the legacy config dir
holds real user state (chat transcripts or credentials), and the current
home's config dir holds no chat transcripts of its own -- so a lived-in new
home is never clobbered, and a fresh workspace (whose /root/.claude never
existed or holds no user state) is untouched.

# CLEANUP: remove this module (and its call in manager.main) once every
# workspace created before the /home/user home layout has booted at least once
# on a release that contains it -- after that, /root/.claude can never hold
# real, unmigrated user state.
