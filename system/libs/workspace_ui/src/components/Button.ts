 * One button system: the class recipe (buttonClass) and the component that

 *
 * `m(Button, {...})` is the default way to make a button: it renders a real
 * <button type="button"> and passes every attr it doesn't consume (onclick,
 * disabled, title, aria-*, data-*) through to the element. Use buttonClass()
 * directly only where a component can't go: a non-button element that must
 * read as a button, or DOM built outside mithril.
 *
 * The Tailwind scanner reads utility names from the literals in this file
 * (base.css's `@source` covers every .ts file): keep every utility name a
 * contiguous literal -- never build one by string interpolation. */
