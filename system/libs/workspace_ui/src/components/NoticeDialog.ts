 * The workspace's one notice modal: a title, a body, and buttons.

 * The backdrop press, the focus rule, and the Escape guard are owned in one place (the Escape
 * listener itself lives on the Modal shell, via ``onEscape``), so every notice behaves the same
 * way rather than the same by coincidence.
 *
 * Dismissal is uniform on purpose: the button, Escape, and a backdrop press all call ``onDismiss``,
 * so a caller cannot make one of them mean something different from the others. A caller that must
 * not be dismissed while it is busy says so with ``isDismissable``.
