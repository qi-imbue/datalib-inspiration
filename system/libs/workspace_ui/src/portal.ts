import m from "mithril";

/** Renders its children into <body>.
 *
 * Popovers here live inside dockview's `overflow: hidden` panels, so anything that extends
 * past its panel is clipped at the edge. Mithril has no portal, so this mounts a detached root
 * and renders into it -- the same shape `lightbox.ts` and `hoverTooltip.ts` use.
 *
 * Children must be positioned in VIEWPORT coordinates (`position: fixed`): they no longer have
 * their original parent to lay them out.
 *
 * The listeners below are the whole reason this file has a comment. Mithril only wires
 * auto-redraw into event handlers for roots created by `m.mount` / `m.route`; `m.render` is
 * documented as the manual API and deliberately does NOT. Without them every handler inside a
 * portalled popover mutates state and then nothing re-renders -- a row click sets the flyout
 * and no flyout appears, a trash click arms "Remove?" and the icon does not change, and the
 * next click outside tears the whole thing down, which is what the user actually sees. So the
 * host re-adds what `m.mount` would have: a redraw after any interaction inside it. Bubble
 * phase, so the target's own handler has already run.
