/**
 * Pure geometry for the combo card's side flyout.
 *
 * The flyout's BASE sits level with the row that opened it and the list grows UPWARD. That is
 * not the ordinary top-align-and-cap-downward rule, and the reason is that this card
 * opens from the composer at the BOTTOM of the panel: a list capped by the space below its row
 * would have roughly three rows to work with, far too few for a thousand-model catalog.
 * Growing up gives it the whole window instead.
 *
 * The search field belongs at the bottom of that column for the same reason -- it stays put,
 * next to the row you came from, while the list extends away from your hand.
 *
 * Kept free of the DOM so it is unit-testable; the caller measures and feeds it in.
