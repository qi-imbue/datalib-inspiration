 * Mithril builds its rejection as `new Error(body)`, and `Error` stringifies
 * whatever it is handed -- so a body it could not read arrives as the *word*
 * "null", not as an absent message. (With `responseType: "json"` and a
 * non-JSON body, `xhr.response` is null and reading `xhr.responseText` throws,
 * which is exactly a proxy's plain-text 503.) An emptiness check alone lets
 * that through. A parsed object body lands here as "[object Object]" the same
 * way. ("undefined" is
 * unreachable from mithril itself -- `new Error(undefined).message` is "" --
 * and is listed only so any other producer of this shape is covered too.)

 * response body, an HTTP status `code`, and a `message`. A gateway error (e.g. a
 * 504 from a front-door proxy) often has no JSON body, so naive
 * `response.detail` extraction yields `null`/`undefined` and surfaces a useless
 * "null" to the user. This walks the available fields in order of usefulness and
