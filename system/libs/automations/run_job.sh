# run_job.sh -- durable, completion-tracked runner for recurring jobs.
#
# Invoked every minute by a /etc/cron.d line (through with_agent_env.sh); runs
# the given command at most once per interval, and retries a run that failed
# or was killed mid-flight. Modeled on the host-backup service's tick loop:
# a run only counts once it COMPLETES.
#
# Usage: run_job.sh <job-id> --every <N[mhd]> [--at <hour>] [--retry-after <N[mhd]>] <command...>
#
#   --every 7d --at 3     weekly at 3 AM local, catch-up after downtime
#   --every 15m           every 15 minutes, no due-hour concept
#   --retry-after 2m      gap before retrying a failed run (default 2m)
#
# State (two timestamps and a counter, under data/.state/ so it survives
# container recreation and is captured by the restic host backup):
#   data/.state/jobs/<job-id>/last_attempt   epoch when a run last STARTED
#   data/.state/jobs/<job-id>/last_success   epoch when a run last COMPLETED (exit 0)
#   data/.state/jobs/<job-id>/failures       consecutive failed attempts
#
# Semantics:
#   - Due when now - last_success >= --every. Only last_success covers a
#     window, so a run that dies mid-flight (machine off, crash, nonzero
#     exit) leaves the window due and is retried -- no sooner than
#     --retry-after since last_attempt.
#   - --at <hour>: wait for that local hour on the day the job comes due;
#     if a whole extra day has passed (overdue by --every + 24h), run at any
#     hour -- the first minute the machine is back up.
#   - No state yet (first run ever): due now, but still waits for --at.
#   - The parent holds a flock for the whole run and runs the command as a
#     child with the lock fd closed, so overlapping ticks skip and the lock
#     can never leak into daemons the command starts (tmux, agents).
#   - At 3 consecutive failures a loud warning is logged; the retry cadence
#     is unchanged (the flock and --retry-after already bound the cost).
#
# Test hooks (used by system/libs/automations/run_job_test.py): MINDS_JOB_STATE_DIR overrides
# the state root; MINDS_JOB_NOW_EPOCH / MINDS_JOB_NOW_HOUR override the clock.
