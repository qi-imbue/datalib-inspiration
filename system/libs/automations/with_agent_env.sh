#
# with_agent_env.sh -- run a command with the agent environment restored.
#
# cron constructs a minimal environment for its jobs (roughly just
# HOME/PATH/SHELL/LOGNAME), so none of the agent env survives into them:
# MNGR_HOST_DIR, MNGR_AGENT_ID, LATCHKEY_*, the PATH that puts uv at
# /root/.local/bin, and so on. All of it is reconstructable from files mngr
# maintains on the host dir, so this wrapper rebuilds it the same way mngr
# itself does for agent operations (build_source_env_prefix): source the host
# env file, then the services agent's own env file on top (agent overrides
# host), exactly like system/scripts/minds_start_services_agent.sh. It then puts
# /root/.local/bin (uv, mngr) on PATH, cds to the repo root, and execs the
# given command.
#
# One deliberate gap: GH_TOKEN is injected per-process into agent sessions and
# never written to these env files, so cron jobs run without it. The only
# consumer is the opt-in github-sync post-commit hook, which silently no-ops
# when the token is absent -- a commit made from a cron job is pushed on the
# next agent-context commit instead.
#
# Every cron job -- the built-in Caretaker entry and any user-added job alike
# -- should be prefixed with it:
#
#   17 3 * * *   root   /home/user/workspace/system/libs/automations/with_agent_env.sh bash my_job.sh >> /var/log/supervisor/my-job.log 2>&1
