# push_upstreams.sh -- split this workspace's committed work to its two
# upstreams, keeping the vendored mngr changes OUT of the dwt branch.
#
#   1. system/vendor/mngr  ->  imbue-ai/mngr-internal            <mngr_branch>
#   2. the workspace       ->  imbue-ai/default-workspace-template <dwt_branch>
#      (with system/vendor/mngr reset to whatever the dwt branch already pins,
#       so no mngr diff ever lands on dwt)
#
# Usage:
#   system/scripts/push_upstreams.sh <dwt_branch> <mngr_branch> [options]
#   system/scripts/push_upstreams.sh <dwt_branch> --dwt-only [options]
#
# Options:
#   --from <ref>   Commit to split (default: HEAD). Only committed work is pushed.
#   --dry-run      Build both commits in throwaway checkouts and show their diffs,
#                  but do NOT push anything. Nothing leaves your machine.
#   --yes          Skip the interactive confirm before each push.
#   --dwt-only     Push ONLY the workspace to dwt, with system/vendor/mngr included
#                  verbatim (no vendoring split). The mngr-internal push is skipped
#                  and the dwt commit carries the FULL tree. Needs only <dwt_branch>
#                  (any <mngr_branch> is ignored).
#
# SAFETY (why this is agent-proof):
#   * URL-ONLY. It never runs `git remote add`; the upstream URLs live only inside
#     throwaway temp checkouts that are deleted at the end. No new remote is ever
#     attached to your repo, so nothing can be `git push`ed there by accident later.
#   * NEVER main. Refuses if either target branch is main/master, and asserts the
#     built dwt commit contains zero system/vendor/mngr paths before pushing.
#   * NO HOOKS. Every internal commit runs with an empty core.hooksPath, so a
#     post-commit / github-sync auto-push cannot fire on a temp branch.
#   * READ-ONLY on your checkout. All work happens in temp worktrees/clones; your
#     current branch, index, and working tree are never touched.
