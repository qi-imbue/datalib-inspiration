# version pins + per-arch sha256s; invoking it here means BOTH docker-built
# images (this script runs in a Dockerfile RUN) and Lima-provisioned VMs (this
# script runs directly in the VM) bake in the scanners from one common place.
# The installer is reachable two ways depending on how we were invoked: in a
# Dockerfile build it sits beside this script's install path as
# default-workspace-template-install-secret-scanners; run straight from the repo (Lima/Modal)
# it is its sibling install_secret_scanners.sh. It is idempotent (skips any tool
# already at its pinned version without network access).
