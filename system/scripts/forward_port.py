"""Register or remove an app port in data/.state/apps.toml.

Uses file locking to safely upsert or remove entries. Called by services
on startup to declare the ports they expose.

Usage:
    python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --manifest system/apps/files/app.toml --url http://localhost:8300
    python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --name terminal --url http://localhost:7681
    python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --icon-file system/apps/foo/icon.svg --name foo --url http://localhost:8090
    python3 system/scripts/forward_port.py --remove --name terminal

This script is deliberately standard-library only: every supervisord program
line runs it under a plain ``python3`` before the program's own command, so
registration must never depend on the root venv being intact. It reads TOML
with ``tomllib`` and writes the registry's flat ``[[apps]]`` shape with the
private writer below.

Manifests
---------
An app with a directory ships ``system/apps/<package>/app.toml`` (see
``system/libs/app_manifest`` for the schema). ``--manifest <path>`` reads it
and copies its static fields onto the row: ``display_name``, ``instances``,
``instances_url``, ``critical``, ``priority``, ``program`` (default: the name),
``internal``, ``launcher_rank``, ``default_shortcut``, and ``actions`` (id,
label, and the names of the params); the icon is read from the file the
manifest names, relative to the manifest. Every manifest field is authoritative
on every call, so a re-registration with a changed manifest updates the row.
Only what is copied from files is checked here (the name rule, the icon markup,
the value types); the manifest's other rules are the ``app_manifest`` library's
job, applied by ``validate-manifest`` and by every reader of the registry.
``--name --url`` without a manifest registers rows for things with no app
directory (owner-exec, the VM exec service, previews, isolated test servers).

Icons
-----
An app may register an icon so the workspace UI can draw it instead of a
generic glyph. **The registry stores the SVG markup itself**, as a plain TOML
string on the entry, not a path to a file. A path would have to be readable by
every consumer -- the system-interface server, the desktop client, and anything
reading the registry off a shared host -- at whatever moment it renders, and
those do not share a filesystem view with the service that registered. The
markup travels with the entry through the existing apps.toml -> app-watcher
event -> WebSocket path with no extra plumbing and no file access at all.
``--icon-file`` (and the manifest's ``icon``) is only an input convenience: the
file is read once here, at registration time, and its contents (not its path)
are what gets persisted.

The markup is validated before it is stored, because it is eventually inlined
into the workspace DOM: ``validate_icon`` accepts exactly one well-formed
``<svg>`` element with nothing that executes or reaches off the page, capped
at ``MAX_ICON_LENGTH`` (see its docstring). An icon is REQUIRED when a
registration would create a new, non-``--internal`` entry; existing entries
re-register untouched. ``--no-icon`` skips the requirement, keeping the
generic letter monogram -- it does not hide the entry (that is
``--internal``'s job).

    passing it sets the field and omitting it clears it, so a registration
