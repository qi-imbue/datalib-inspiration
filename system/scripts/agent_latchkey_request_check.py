"""Decide whether a Bash command files a latchkey permission request badly.

Takes the command as its positional argument, optionally preceded by
``--backgrounded`` when the tool call runs the command in the background (both
passed by agent_latchkey_request_standalone.sh, which reads them out of the
hook payload). Exits 0 to allow; exits 2 with a guiding stderr message to BLOCK.
See the wrapper for the why.

The command structure (which segments POST to the permission-requests host,
whether one is chained or redirected) comes from the shared `tk_command_parsing`
parser -- despite the name it is a general shell-command splitter, tokenizing
with `shlex` so quoting, escapes, comments, env-var prefixes, and operators are
interpreted the way a shell would. A rationale string that happens to mention
`&&` or `>` therefore stays inside one token and never trips the checks.

This hook runs under a bare `python3` with no virtualenv (see the wrapper), so
it puts the parser lib's source directory on `sys.path` explicitly rather than
relying on an installed package; the lib is stdlib-only for the same reason.
