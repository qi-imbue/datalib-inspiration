"""Send a message to a chat, by chat id, through the chat app.

Usage, from the repo root (every skill's cwd)::

    python3 system/scripts/message_chat.py <chat-id> -m "text"
    python3 system/scripts/message_chat.py <chat-id> --message-file path/to/task.md
    some-command | python3 system/scripts/message_chat.py <chat-id>
    python3 system/scripts/message_chat.py <chat-id> --system -m "an automated nudge"

This is the in-workspace replacement for ``mngr message <agent>``. A chat is
addressed by its chat id (``$MINDS_CHAT_ID`` on an agent the chat app created; the
id of its first agent, so ``$MNGR_AGENT_ID`` for an agent that is its own chat),
never by its mngr name: a rename changes the name mid-task, and once a chat can
hand off between agents (``docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/``) the chat
app is the only thing that knows which agent is currently taking its messages.
The message is POSTed to the chat app's own send route on loopback, and the
route's verdict is the script's exit status, in ``mngr message``'s vocabulary:

    0  delivered or queued
    1  refused, or the chat app could not be reached and the backoff failed too
    7  delivered, but the agent's input is blocked on a dialog (``mngr
       message``'s "delivered but blocked" code)

``mngr message`` is used only as a BACKOFF, when the chat app cannot take the
message at all: the connection to it fails, or its route keeps answering 404
(an older chat app without the route, or an agent it does not know; a
just-created agent is unknown for a moment after its create, so a 404 is retried
briefly first). Any other answer is the chat app's decision and is never
second-guessed by pasting the text around it: a refusal during a handoff is
what keeps the message from landing on the wrong agent, and a blocked send has
already put the text in the pane. The backoff passes ``--start``: the chat app's
route revives a stopped agent on send, so the backoff does the same.

A 503 means the chat app is up but not ready (it has not read its agent list
from mngr yet, or the agent's daemon is still starting), so it is retried for a
bounded window before it counts as a failure.

Once the chat app has accepted the request, the script waits for its answer with
no read timeout: the route blocks for as long as the harness takes to accept the
text, and giving up part-way would be the one way to deliver the message twice.
The connect timeout is short so an unreachable chat app is detected fast.

``--system`` wraps the text in the sentinel the chat transcript renders as a
collapsed system chip instead of a user bubble (the browser app's wake-up
nudges use it); the tag is pinned against the chat app's copy by a test there.

Standard library only: skills run this as ``python3 system/scripts/...`` and
cron runs it before any venv exists. The chat app is found through its row in
the app registry (``data/.state/apps.toml``, or ``$MINDS_APPS_FILE``), with the
chat app's fixed port as the fallback.
