"""Tests for the agent-facing refresh_workspace_view.py helper.

These tests exercise the contract the update flows depend on:

- Both channels fire on every run, independently -- the WebSocket broadcast
  reaches shared tunnel viewers the Minds app cannot, and the app call reaches
  the desktop app without going through the workspace server at all.
- One channel failing never suppresses the other, and no failure is fatal:
  a stale tab must not fail a reveal whose change already landed on disk.
- The app call addresses the workspace's PRIMARY agent, and is skipped outright
  rather than aimed at the caller when that cannot be resolved.
- The app call carries the per-agent override JWT when the gateway issues one and
  goes out without it when the gateway does not, so neither gateway topology
  loses the channel.
