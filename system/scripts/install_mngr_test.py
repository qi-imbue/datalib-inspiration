"""Tests for the mngr tool install.

The real install is a ``uv tool install`` against the network, so the program is handed a
recorder in place of ``subprocess.run``: it runs whole, and what the recorder keeps is
what uv would have been told to do -- the argument vector, the tool directories in its
environment, and its working directory. The pieces that decide those are also checked on
their own, where a failure names itself.
