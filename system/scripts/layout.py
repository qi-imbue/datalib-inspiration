"""Agent-facing helper for inspecting and mutating the workspace layout, over addresses.

Subcommands:
    list                                List every app with its instances (address, title, status, where docked).
    inspect                             Describe the live dock (compact by default; --verbose for the YAML tree).
    where <address>                     Show one panel: its group's tab-mates and the addresses in each direction.
    context                             Show each browser client's recent messages, device kind, and active view.
    views                               List the views (projects + Everything): tab sets and the clients on each.
    load <view>                         Switch the target client onto a view.
    open <address|url>                  Dock an instance next to the caller's chat (focus it when it is already open),
                                        create one (--action / --param), or open a URL in a new browser.
    focus <address>                     Activate the named panel within its group.
    split <address> [...]               Add a panel relative to another panel; tabs into an adjacent group by default.
    close <address>                     Remove the named panel.
    move <address> --relative-to <address> [...]  Relocate a panel; iframe DOM is preserved.
    rename <address> <title>            Retitle an instance through its app (the title shows in every view).
    delete <address>                    Delete an instance through its app (it leaves every view).
    stop <address>                      Stop what backs an instance (a chat's agent, a browser's Chromium, a
                                        terminal's session) through its app; the instance stays, as ``stopped``.
    start <address>                     Bring a stopped instance back through its app.
    replace-url <address> <path-or-url> Point an instance at a path under its app, or at a URL for an app that browses.
    maximize <address>                  Maximize the panel's group within the dock.
    restore                             Exit a maximized group.
    refresh <address>                   Reload one iframe; a bare app address reloads every iframe of that app.
    shortcuts                           List a view's rail shortcuts (app, action, mode).
    shortcut set <app> <action> [...]   Add a rail shortcut to a project, or change its mode.
    shortcut remove <app> <action>      Take a rail shortcut off a project.

Every instance is named by one *address* (contracts.md section 1):

- ``app:<name>?instance=<key>`` -- one instance of an app: a chat by its chat id
  (``app:chat?instance=agent-...``, the id of its first agent), a terminal by its tmux
  session name
  (``app:terminal?instance=terminal-3``), a browser by its name.
- ``app:<name>`` -- a single-instance app's one tab (an app built without instances, say
  ``app:docs``), or, as an ``open`` / ``split`` target, "a fresh instance of this app" for an
  app that has instances (``open app:terminal``, ``open app:files``).

A bare word is shorthand for ``app:<word>``; a bare ``https://`` URL opens a new browser on
that page. The old ``chat:`` / ``terminal:`` / ``service:`` / ``url:`` / ``subagent:``
spellings are refused with the address to use instead; ``list`` shows every address on the
machine.

The workspace shows one *view* at a time: a project, or ``Everything`` (the unfiltered
home). Every browser *client* (one per browser, shared by its windows) has one active view and
its own arrangement of every view, kept in a file on the shell that is the truth of the
arrangement. Every op targets exactly one client: ``--client <id>`` (from ``context``), else
the client that most recently messaged you, else the one connected client; with several
clients and no way to tell, the op is refused and lists them. The shell edits that client's
file itself, so an op lands whether or not a browser is connected, and a connected window
shows it within a redraw. An op edits the client's active view; ``--view <name>`` (a
project's name, or ``Everything``) edits that view's arrangement and switches the client to
it. ``context`` tells you which client (and view, and device kind) recently messaged each chat.

``--direction`` on ``split`` / ``move`` accepts five values: ``left`` / ``right`` /
``above`` / ``below`` target the *adjacent* group in that direction (tabbing into one that
already lives there unless ``--new-group`` is passed), and ``within`` tabs the panel into
the anchor's *own* group.

The document ops (``open`` / ``split`` / ``move`` / ``focus`` / ``close``) answer with the
arrangement as the shell wrote it, so on success they print a concise description on stderr
at once; ``open`` of an app (or a URL) creates the instance through the app inside the op and
prints the new address to stdout, and an app's refusal is the op's error. ``maximize`` /
``restore`` / ``refresh`` change what is on screen without changing the saved arrangement,
so they are sent to the target client's windows and confirm the send. ``rename`` /
``delete`` / ``replace-url`` / ``stop`` / ``start`` go through the shell's relay to the app
that owns the instance and echo the app's refusal when it gives one (an instance that cannot
be stopped on its own, such as a file viewer, refuses ``stop`` with a 400).

All dock ops POST one body ``{op, args, requester}`` to a loopback-only endpoint on the
shell: ``requester`` is the caller's own chat, ``app:chat?instance=$MINDS_CHAT_ID`` (the chat
app sets ``MINDS_CHAT_ID`` on every agent it creates; ``MNGR_AGENT_ID`` stands in for an
agent that is its own chat), which is what ``self`` means and how the shell attributes the
op to a client (the one that last messaged that chat).

Output for ``list`` / ``views`` / ``context`` / ``shortcuts`` is YAML by default; pass
``--json`` for the raw structured object. ``inspect`` and ``where`` default to a compact
rendering; ``--verbose`` prints the full YAML tree.
