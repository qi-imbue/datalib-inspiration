# First-boot seed script for default-workspace-template containers.
#
# Run synchronously by mngr (via the `post_host_create_command` create-
# template hook) once the host is online but before any agent work_dir
# setup. Responsibilities:
#
#   1. Seed the /home/user persistent volume with the baked workspace at
#      ~/workspace using an atomic two-step move via /home/user/workspace.moving
#      so a crash mid-copy never leaves /home/user/workspace half-populated.
#      The workspace was baked into /home/user/workspace at image-build time
#      and then renamed to /docker_build_code at the very end of the build (so
#      the runtime /home/user volume mount path is empty in the shipped
#      image); this script relocates it onto the volume.
#
#   2. Clean up /docker_build_code after seeding succeeds, so it doesn't
#      keep occupying overlay space on the running container.
#
#   3. Seed the home skeleton on the volume: ~/worktrees, the ~/.cache ->
#      /var/cache/user symlink (so even tools that hardcode ~/.cache stay off
#      the volume and out of backups), a minimal ~/.bashrc (PATH + mngr env
#      sourcing -- root's dotfiles live on the volume now), and the
#      ~/.mngr/layout-version stamp so every backup self-describes its data
#      layout.
#
# This script is installed at /usr/local/bin/default-workspace-template-seed by an image-layer
# COPY (not via the volume-bound /home/user/) so that it is available
# before the seed step itself runs.
#
# Race-free: mngr blocks on this command's exit before issuing any other
# work that touches /home/user/. No PID-1 / signal-handling logic here -- the
# container's long-running CMD (mngr's generic keep-alive) handles that.
