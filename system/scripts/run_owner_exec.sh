# Register the port from here rather than letting the daemon do it

# owner-exec must be registered --internal -- it has a port to forward but no
# page of its own, so a plain row puts an openable-looking app in the New Tab
# launcher and the All apps popover that opens blank. The pinned Go binary has
# no flag for that; the row is static (name + url), so registering it once
# here before exec is equivalent to the daemon doing it at startup.
