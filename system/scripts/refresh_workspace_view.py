"""Rebuild the user's view of this workspace after its interface changed.

Run this after anything that makes the running UI stale -- above all
``mngr start --restart system-services``, which bounces the system-interface
backend underneath whatever the user currently has open. Nothing else reloads
that view: the Minds app only intervenes when a workspace looks *unreachable*
for a sustained stretch, and a services restart that comes back quickly never
crosses that bar.

Two channels, because neither reaches every viewer:

``reload_system_interface`` broadcast (the workspace's own WebSocket)
    Reaches every *browser* attached to the system interface, including anyone
    the user shared the workspace with over a Cloudflare tunnel. Best-effort by
    nature: it is a live fan-out with no replay, so it reaches whoever is
    connected at that instant and nobody else. After a services restart that is
    often nobody -- browsers reconnect on exponential backoff -- so treat it as
    a bonus rather than the guarantee.

``POST /api/v1/agents/<primary>/refresh`` (the Minds app, via the gateway)
    Reaches only the desktop app, but does not go through the workspace server
    at all, so it works while that server is still coming back. This is the
    channel that actually covers the common case: a user looking at the
    workspace in the Minds app.

Every outcome is reported on stderr and the exit code is always 0. The change
has already landed on disk; failing a reveal because the user had the window
shut would be worse than a stale tab.

Run via bare ``python3`` (standard library only), like ``forward_port.py`` -- it
runs from restart paths that must not depend on a synced venv.

Usage:
    python3 system/scripts/refresh_workspace_view.py

Environment:
    MINDS_WORKSPACE_SERVER_URL  Base URL of the live workspace server
                                (default http://127.0.0.1:8000).
    LATCHKEY_GATEWAY,           Gateway address + password mngr injects into the
    LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD   agent environment. Both must be present to reach
                                the Minds app; the broadcast still runs without
                                them.
    LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE
                                The per-agent authorization JWT, forwarded when
                                set. Only a desktop-hosted gateway injects it, so
                                its absence is normal and not a reason to skip
                                the app refresh.
