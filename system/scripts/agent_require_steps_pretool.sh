# PreToolUse hook: soft-block substantive tool calls when the agent has no
# in_progress step record. Injects a system reminder the agent can see while
# letting the tool call proceed, rather than hard-blocking (exit 2).
#
# IMPORTANT: for PreToolUse, plain stdout on exit 0 is written only to the
# debug log -- the agent never sees it (unlike UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart,
# where stdout is added to context). To reach the agent without blocking, the
# reminder must be emitted as JSON via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext,
# which Claude Code injects as a system reminder next to the tool result.
# See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.
#
# Skipped for read-only / introspection tools (Read, Glob, Grep, etc.) and
# for Bash commands that invoke tk itself (so the agent can create steps).

You have declared step records but none is currently in_progress. Call \`tk start <id>\` on your next step before doing more work. Steps must be serial -- only one in_progress at a time.

[Step tracking reminder]

You are about to do work without declaring any step records. The chat progress view requires steps to render your work as a structured timeline.

Before continuing, declare your plan as step records (each prints \`Created <id>: <title>\`):
  tk create --step \"Description of first step\"
  tk create --step \"Description of second step\"
  ...
Then start the first step with its literal id: tk start <id>

See CLAUDE.md > Task management for the full protocol.
