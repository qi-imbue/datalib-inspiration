"""Tests for the per-project changelog gate.

The gate maps changed files to the projects that own them and fails when a
touched project is missing its per-PR entry file. The most important behaviors
to lock down are: (1) it refuses to pass vacuously when the only resolvable
diff base is HEAD itself (the sandbox / shallow-clone footgun), and (2) it maps
files to projects and detects missing entries correctly against a real git
repo.
