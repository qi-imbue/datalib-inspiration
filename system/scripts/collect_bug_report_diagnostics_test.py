"""Tests for the resident bug-report diagnostics collector.

Each test loads its own fresh copy of the script as a module and rebinds the
container paths it hardcodes (the workspace layout, the supervisord log dir,
mngr's agent tree, the secret-scan gate) at tmp fixtures, then drives the
helpers or ``main`` directly. The scan gate is exercised end to end through
stub ``scan_secrets.sh`` scripts on disk that reproduce the real gate's output
markers verbatim.
