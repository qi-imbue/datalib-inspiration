"""Enforce that a PR adds one changelog entry per project it touches.

This is the changelog gate. It runs on a real checkout (a local clone or the
GitHub Actions runner) -- the only place a real base ref exists. Its single
input is the set of files this PR changed relative to its base; that diff is
computed here, where the base ref is present, and the gate refuses to run (loud
non-zero exit) rather than pass vacuously when it cannot establish a base
distinct from HEAD.

A "project" is a directory under ``system/libs/``, ``system/services/``, or
``system/apps/`` containing a ``pyproject.toml``, the synthetic ``agents``
bucket that owns the ``.agents`` tree (skills and shared agent config), or the
synthetic ``dev`` bucket that owns everything else (system/scripts/, .github/,
docs/, build tooling). Each
project holds its per-PR entries in ``<project_dir>/changelog/`` (the
``agents`` bucket's entries live in ``.agents/changelog/``, the ``dev``
bucket's in ``system/changelog/``); a PR that touches a project must add
``<project_dir>/changelog/<branch>.md`` (slashes in the branch name replaced
with dashes).

The gate is pure stdlib so it can run without ``uv sync``. Run it from the repo
root::

    python system/scripts/check_changelog_entries.py

Exit codes:
    0  -- ok (entries present, or nothing to check: not a PR branch / no
          project files changed)
    1  -- one or more touched projects are missing their entry file
    2  -- cannot establish a usable diff base (misconfiguration); never a
          silent pass
