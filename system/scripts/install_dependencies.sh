# workspace/local packages). Needs the dependency manifests present but not the
# full source, so the Dockerfile runs it right after copying the manifests (to
# preserve layer caching) and the Lima provider runs it after the repo is synced
# into the VM. Runs as root and is idempotent.

# NOTE: intentionally NOT guarded by the provisioning skip cache -- this produces
# in-repo outputs (.venv, node_modules) that the create's git-mirror landing does
# not carry, so it must run on every create to regenerate them (fast via the
# baked warm uv/npm caches). Only setup_system (global-only effects) is skipped.

# Pin uv to a Python that satisfies the lockfile (>=3.12). The Docker base ships
# 3.12; on other bases setup_system.sh fetched a uv-managed 3.12, so point uv at
# it. No-op when system Python is already >=3.12 (Docker build unchanged).
