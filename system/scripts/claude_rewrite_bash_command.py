"""PreToolUse hook: rewrite each Bash command before it runs.

A claude agent runs shell commands through the Bash tool. This hook rewrites
every such command by prepending two things, then runs the original command
verbatim at the end:

1. An oom self-tag. The agent's subprocesses (builds, test runs, browsers) are
   exactly what should be shed first under memory pressure -- before the agent
   itself, and before any other agent. They inherit the agent's own band by
   default, which is not expendable enough, so the prefix raises the running
   shell's ``oom_score_adj`` to the most-expendable band; everything the shell
   spawns inherits it. Raising ``oom_score_adj`` is unprivileged, so it needs no
   special capability. The write is gated on ``test -w`` so that on a host
   without a writable ``/proc/self/oom_score_adj`` (e.g. macOS, which has no
   ``/proc``) the prefix is a clean no-op that emits nothing -- a bare
   ``> /proc/...`` redirect would otherwise leak a shell "no such file or
   directory" error past ``2>/dev/null``.

2. This agent's git commit identity, as ``GIT_AUTHOR_*`` / ``GIT_COMMITTER_*``
   exports. git resolves author/committer from these env vars ahead of any
   config, so every commit the agent makes through the Bash tool is attributed
   to the agent rather than to whatever ``user.name`` the checkout inherited at
   create time (which is the operator's, copied from the source host). The name
   is the agent's *current* mngr name, read live so a ``mngr rename`` is
   reflected on the next commit without restarting the agent; the email is the
   agent's mngr routing address in id form (``<agent_id>@<host_id>``), which is
   stable across renames and still routes via ``mngr message``. When the
   identity can't be fully resolved (e.g. run outside a mngr container), the
   git prefix is omitted and git falls back to its own resolution.

Each prefix ends with ``;`` (not ``&&``) so the original command runs regardless
of whether the tag applied. The exports use ``export`` (not an inline
``VAR=x cmd`` assignment) so they reach a ``git`` invoked anywhere inside a
compound command, not just a bare leading one.

This must remain the single PreToolUse hook that rewrites the command (the only
one emitting ``updatedInput``), so the inspection hooks (commit-guard,
tk-standalone, step-gate) always act on the original command. Claude Code runs a
matcher's hooks in parallel with no defined reconciliation of multiple
``updatedInput`` outputs, so a second rewriter would nondeterministically clobber
this one -- fold any further command rewriting in here rather than adding one.

Output contract (Claude Code hooks): for a Bash call, print a JSON object with
``hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput.command`` set to the rewritten command. For any
other tool, or a malformed payload, print nothing and exit 0 (pass through).

Self-contained beyond the stdlib-only ``oom_priority`` package (imported via a
``sys.path`` insert), since claude runs PreToolUse hooks under a plain
``python3``.
