# Render the workspace's snapshot-pinned apt sources.
#
# Every apt operation in a default-workspace-template environment resolves
# against the Debian archive frozen at a single timestamp T (the committed
# value in .mngr/apt-snapshot-timestamp), so package versions are a pure
# function of T: image builds, boot-time convergence, and agent-initiated
# installs all see the same universe, and versions change only when T is
# deliberately advanced (see the update-self flow).
#
# Source selection:
#   - Default: imbue's mirror at https://apt.imbuepackages.com (a Cloudflare
#     Worker in front of R2; see apps/apt_mirror in the mngr monorepo). It
#     serves indexes frozen verbatim (upstream Debian signatures intact) and
#     read-through-caches the pool, so it is fast and unthrottled. Override
#     the base with APT_MIRROR_BASE_URL.
#   - APT_MIRROR_BASE_URL set but EMPTY: fall back to snapshot.debian.org at
#     the same T directly. Identical content, but snapshot.debian.org
#     throttles, so this is the degraded path for mirror outages.
# Exactly one source set is written: apt update hard-fails when ANY configured
# source is unreachable, so listing both would turn a mirror outage into a
# broken workspace instead of a slow one. Re-run this script to switch.
#
# Check-Valid-Until is disabled because frozen Release files eventually pass
# their Valid-Until date; authenticity still comes from the archive signature.
#
# Usage: write_apt_sources.sh [T]
#   T defaults to the committed .mngr/apt-snapshot-timestamp next to this repo.
