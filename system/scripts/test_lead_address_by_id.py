"""A worker's lead address survives a rename because it is the lead's agent id.

`create_worker.py launch` stamps `lead_agent` with the lead's id, and `worker-reporting.md`
has the worker read `mngr transcript $LEAD_AGENT`. This runs the real vendored mngr to pin
the fact it rests on: an agent stays reachable by its id across a `mngr rename`, and is
not reachable by its old name. It costs a `uv run mngr create`.
