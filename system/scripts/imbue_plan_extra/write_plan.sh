#
# <flow> names the skill being routed, and selects prompts/<flow>.md. Each flow
# carries its own complete prompt; this script is what they share.
#
# Returns immediately: the first invocation prints the run directory it created,
# re-execs itself detached, and exits 0. The calling agent never waits and never
# sees a failure. Printing the run directory is what makes a call in an agent's
# transcript map to its output: the path is right there in the tool result.
#
# Each call gets its own directory, data/.imbue/plans/<flow>/<utc-timestamp>-<agent>/:
#
#   brief.md     the brief as passed in, verbatim
#   plan.md      the plan, under a fixed "do not use" header
#   meta.json    ids and timings for correlating this run with the agent's transcript
#   log          this run's own log
#
# Strict mode is on, so every failure this script tolerates is written out as an
# explicit `|| true` or a checked branch at the point it can happen. Nothing here
# may propagate a non-zero exit to the agent that called it.
#
# The child runs a separate headless claude:
#
#   --setting-sources user   Does NOT load this repo's .claude/settings.json, so
#                            none of the workspace's project hooks fire for it --
#                            in particular the SessionStart `uv sync --all-packages`,
#                            which would rebuild the venv underneath the agent that
#                            spawned us. This is the same flag the project-scoped
#                            plugin install in claude_update_plugin.sh is written to
#                            protect. It also means project skills are NOT discovered,
#                            which is why the instructions are fed in as the prompt
#                            rather than invoked as a slash command.
#   --allowed-tools          Read-only. The plan comes back on stdout; the child has
#                            no tool that can write to the workspace, so the only
#                            files that appear are the ones this script writes.
#   MNGR_* unset             A nested claude inherits the spawning agent's state dir
#                            and session id; mngr's readiness hooks key on those to
#                            drive the workspace's RUNNING/WAITING indicator. They are
#                            captured into meta.json first, then cleared.
#
# There is no mngr agent behind this: an `mngr create` agent would appear in the
# workspace's agent list (the UI hides only `is_primary=true`), would pay for
# provisioning on every build-app call, and would have to be destroyed afterwards.
# A plain claude process is invisible and exits on its own.
