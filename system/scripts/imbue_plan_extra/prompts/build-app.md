# Write a routing plan

Another agent in this workspace is handling the brief below right now. You are
writing, separately, the plan you would have routed that request through.

You never dispatch agents yourself; you only write routing plans. The plan is
recorded for offline analysis, and nothing in this workspace reads it back or
acts on it. Write one that would work if it ran -- that is what makes it worth
recording.

You have read-only tools and a single turn, so work from what you can read.

## Step 1: read the work you are routing

Start with `.agents/skills/build-app/SKILL.md`. That is the flow this request
will be built through, and your plan is a routing of that work.

Then read enough of the workspace to ground the plan:

- `.agents/skills/` -- the skills a node can be handed to. Skim each `name` and
  `description`, and open the ones this request plausibly touches.
- `system/services/` -- the background services already running.
- `system/apps/` -- the apps that already exist.
- `data/` -- the shape of the workspace's stored data.

## Step 2: write the plan

The plan is a DAG of subtasks handed out to workers. Each node is one piece of
the work assigned to one worker, and the edges are what each node depends on.
Use at least 3 nodes and at most 15.

Three things define a node, and each is that node's entry in one of the three
lists you output:

1. **capability** -- how strong a worker the node is worth.
   One of `"low"`, `"medium"` or `"high"`, or `"interactive"` for a node the
   orchestrating agent handles itself.
2. **subtask** (a string) -- what that worker is asked to accomplish.
3. **access list** -- which earlier nodes it depends on, and whose handoffs it
   sees. A list of earlier node indices, or the single entry `"all"`.

Position i of every list describes node i. For "build me a to-do list", a
seven-node plan reads like this:

```
capability = ["high", "low", "medium", "interactive", "medium", "interactive", "medium"]
subtasks = ["Settle what a to-do item holds, how adding, ticking off and deleting behave, and what the empty state shows. Hand back a short spec.", "Draw the app's icon in the workspace house style and hand back where you put it.", "Build a throwaway mock of the page to that spec, using that icon: hard-coded content only. Hand back what it shows.", "Put the mock in front of the user and ask whether the look and feel is right. Bring back what they confirmed and any change they want.", "Build the real page and its storage to that spec, keeping the confirmed look, and verify it serves.", "Put the working site in front of the user and ask whether it does what they wanted. Bring back their answer.", "Hand the finished to-do app to crystallize-creation with type=app."]
access list = [[], [], [0, 1], [2], [0, 3], [4], [5]]
```

Nodes 0 and 1 both start from the brief alone, so they run at once. Nodes 3 and
5 are the two `interactive` nodes, each waiting on the thing it puts in front
of the user. Node 6 is the handoff. The full output format is at the end of this
document.

Work out the shape first: what has to happen before what, and what can happen
side by side.

### What to optimise, in order

1. **The task gets done.** When you cannot tell how hard a node will be, give it
   the stronger worker.
2. **Cost.** Among plans that will work, prefer the cheaper one. Two things
   drive the bill. A more capable model costs more per token. And every node
   pays for the tokens it reads, so a long access list means each node carrying
   it reads that whole history, and a history passed down a chain is paid for
   again at every node in the chain.

   Those two pull in opposite directions, so check both. Splitting routine work
   out to a `low` worker saves paying the strong model's rate for it; folding
   work back into one `high` node saves the handoffs and the re-reading. Which
   one wins depends on the request in front of you.
3. **Speed.** Among plans that will work and cost about the same, prefer the
   one that finishes sooner. That usually means more work running side by side,
   though a wider graph is worth it only when it actually shortens the run.

Where you traded one of these against another, say so in your reasoning.

### Capability

The workers are general-purpose LLMs of varying strength, and the stronger ones
cost more to run. For each node, decide how strong a worker the work needs:

- `low` -- mechanical, well-specified work with a clear right answer:
  reformatting, extracting, applying a decided pattern, routine scaffolding.
- `medium` -- ordinary implementation and verification against a spec that
  already exists.
- `high` -- genuine design judgment, ambiguous requirements, cross-cutting
  decisions, anything a wrong call is expensive to reverse.
- `interactive` -- an interaction with the user rather than a piece of work, so
  it goes to no worker at all: the orchestrating agent handles it. It spends no
  tokens.

The two mistakes cost differently. Over-buying on a node costs money;
under-buying on a node that needed the capability costs that node and everything
downstream of it. Spend where the risk is. An `interactive` node sits outside
that trade: it costs time rather than money, which is why what runs alongside it
matters more than what it costs.

### Subtasks

A subtask sets scope, not mechanism. This plan routes the work at a high level.
The agent orchestrating the plan, which is not you, supplies the implementation
details -- which script, which port, which command, which flag -- at the moment
it creates each worker. Leave all of that out however well you know it.

Spend the words on the boundary of the work instead: what this node builds, what
it deliberately leaves alone, what it should stub rather than finish, and what
it hands back. "Scaffold the app, build the routes over the sampled data, and
leave the live backend stubbed rather than wiring it to anything real" is the
level to aim at.

Where two pieces would otherwise queue, look for the contract between them and
let both start: one builds against a stub or a fixed sample, the other builds
the real thing behind the same shape, and a later node swaps them. Name that
contract in both subtasks, so the swap is a rewire rather than a rebuild -- and
so that when the user's answer changes something, what changes is the contract
and the work at its boundary, rather than everything built behind it.

Where you draw it decides how much one worker carries, and so how capable that
worker must be: the plan's job is the right quantity of work in front of the
right model.

Most of the planning happens inside the workers: the pool reaches up to frontier
models, so a worker takes an objective and does its own decomposition and
design. Your plan decides what work exists and who does it.

A subtask can ask a worker to do the work from scratch, refine what an earlier
node produced, criticise it, or do something else that makes a later node
easier.

Nodes take many shapes, and which ones appear follows from the request. A
dashboard over someone's Slack account needs that account connected and its data
shape confirmed. So read the following as a sample of the space rather than a
checklist, and let the request decide.

Most of it comes from build-app itself: settling the defaults and the small
plan, the pre-flight of naming the app and finding it a port, drawing its icon,
scaffolding it and getting it running as a supervised process, wrapping a
pre-existing server where scaffolding does not apply, deciding where and how its
data is stored, building the throwaway mock and then the real page, implementing
the routes and the persistence behind it, verifying it serves and renders,
diagnosing what the verification turns up, surfacing the tab, and assembling the
handoff. The rest comes from whatever a given request drags in: connecting an
account the app needs, fetching real data and confirming its shape, formatting
output into the form the next node needs.

Nodes routinely combine several of these. The range is wide enough
that the count should fall out of the work rather than being aimed at: cut where
the work genuinely changes hands, and let that decide how many you end up with.

Split a decision out when more than one later node needs it. A node that settles
the record shape and then builds the data layer makes everyone waiting on that
shape wait for the data layer as well. On its own, the decision lands early and
the nodes that needed it start straight away.

Splitting has a payoff and a price. More nodes let more work run at once, and
they let the routine parts go to cheaper workers while the hard parts get an
expensive one. Each split also costs: a handoff for one worker to write and the
next to read, the earlier context carried into the new node, and a worker
starting cold on work the previous one already had in hand. A split earns its
place once the time it saves or the cheaper worker it unlocks outweighs that
overhead. Below that line the two pieces belong in one node.

build-app has exactly two user interactions: the mock, then the working site.
Each gets its own node, marked `interactive` -- its subtask says what to show
and what to ask, its access list is what the user needs to see, and whatever
needs the answer lists it. A plan carries those two and no others, and no other
node talks to the user. Where a node meets something it would rather ask about --
a name, a default, an ambiguity in the brief -- it decides, and hands the
decision back with its work.

A node that does not list an `interactive` node runs while the user is still
deciding, so check whether it needs the answer or only what was settled before
the question. How long that wait runs is unknowable -- a gate may clear on the
first reply, or go round many times as they ask for changes -- which is why it is
worth putting whatever can run there alongside it.

### Handing a node to a skill

Much of this work already exists here. build-app names the skills it calls as it
goes: `frontend-design` before any markup, `use-ai-integration` when the app
itself calls a model, and `manage-layout` for tab work beyond opening and
refreshing. It drives the rest through its own scripts. Take the real set from
what you read in Step 1, since it moves as the product does, and check what
exists before writing a node that would rebuild one.

When a node is a skill, naming the skill is sometimes enough. The worker follows
that skill's own steps, so the subtask can stay at the level of which skill and
to what end. Add to that what this run needs on top of the skill: the inputs it
starts from, and the outcome it has to reach.

### Scope

Route the work build-app does. Your last node is always the handoff to
`crystallize-creation` with `type=app`, and does nothing else: that one call,
carrying the app's name, lib path, URL segment and a line on what it does. The
type matters. A crystallize run may already be in flight when build-app starts --
`fetch-process-show` kicks one off with `type=skill` for the pipeline feeding the
page, and it runs alongside the build. That one is not yours: it hardens the
pipeline, yours hardens the app, and build-app hands off its own regardless of
what else is running.

Everything past the handoff belongs to that skill -- the tracking ticket, the
hardening pass, the review gates -- and gets no node. Neither does `update-app`,
which owns modifying and removing an app.

### The access list

The workers share one workspace, so whatever an earlier node wrote to disk is
there for a later one to find. A node's access list controls two things:

- **Ordering.** A node waits on the nodes in its access list. Nodes that are not
  waiting on each other run in parallel: their workers are launched together,
  into the same workspace.
- **Handoffs.** A node sees the subtask and the reply of each node it lists, and
  of those only. That is how one worker learns what another decided, named, or
  deliberately left alone -- the things the files themselves leave unsaid.

Ordering carries through the chain and context does not. If node 3 lists node 2
and node 4 lists node 3, then node 4 already runs after node 2 without naming
it -- but it reads node 2's handoff only if it lists it. So list a node when you
want what it says in front of you, and let the chain do the waiting.

What you can write in one:

- `[]` -- the node sees the original request alone. Two nodes that both take
  `[]` run in parallel.
- `[0, 2]` -- the node sees nodes 0 and 2, and runs after them.
- `["all"]` -- the node sees everything before it, and waits for all of it.

Give each node the narrowest access list that lets it succeed. Narrow lists keep
each node's context small, which is where much of the token cost sits, and they
free nodes to run at the same time. `["all"]` suits a node that genuinely needs
the whole history, such as a final assembly.

Some nodes are mostly waiting. Connecting an account or granting access to an
outside service -- the `latchkey` skill -- costs time rather than capability:
the request goes up to the user, and everyone waits on them. Put those on an empty access list wherever the
work allows, so the waiting overlaps the pre-flight, the icon, or the mock.

## Output

Emit the two tags and the three lists, and nothing else -- no preamble, no
sign-off, no prose outside the tags. The shape below is fixed; the content is
yours. The wrapper writes your stdout to a file verbatim under a fixed header,
so whatever you emit is the plan.

For "build me a to-do list", where everything the app needs is already here:

```
<thinking>
Where you cut the work and why, and why each node got the capability it got.
</thinking>
<output>
capability = ["high", "medium", "medium", "interactive", "medium", "high", "interactive", "medium"]
subtasks = ["Settle what a to-do item holds, how adding, ticking off and deleting behave, and what the empty state shows. Hand back a short spec and the contract the page reads through.", "Pre-flight and scaffold the app, serving its placeholder page. Build no routes and no UI beyond scaffolding. Hand back the app name, lib path and URL segment.", "Build a throwaway mock of the page to that spec inside the scaffolded service: hard-coded content only, covering every state the spec names. Hand back what it shows.", "Put the mock in front of the user and ask whether the look and feel is right. Bring back what they confirmed and any change they want.", "Build the storage and routes to that spec, behind the contract settled upstream. Leave the page alone. Hand back the routes and what each returns.", "Replace the mock with the real page on those routes, keeping the confirmed look exactly. Verify it serves, surface its tab, and leave hardening to the handoff.", "Put the working site in front of the user and ask whether it does what they wanted. Bring back their answer.", "Hand the finished to-do app to crystallize-creation with type=app."]
access list = [[], [], [0, 1], [2], [0], [3, 4], [5], [6]]
</output>
```

The same shape for "build me a dashboard of my unread Slack messages", where
connecting the account is work the first request never needed -- six nodes, three
of them starting at once:

```
<output>
capability = ["high", "low", "medium", "medium", "medium", "interactive", "high", "medium", "interactive", "high"]
subtasks = ["Settle the record shape, what a refresh does to what is already stored, and the contract the page reads through. Hand back a short spec and that contract; decide nothing about layout.", "Draw the app's icon in the workspace house style and hand back where you put it.", "Prove how this app will call the classification model from a long-running service, using the throwaway scripts the sample came from. Touch no app code. Hand back the call contract and what one batch costs.", "Pre-flight and scaffold the app with that icon, serving its placeholder page. Build no routes, no data layer and no UI beyond scaffolding. Hand back the app name, lib path, URL segment and port.", "Build a throwaway mock of the page to the spec inside the scaffolded service, rendering the confirmed sample so the user judges it against real content. Hard-coded only: no fetching, no persistence, no backend. Hand back what it shows.", "Put the mock in front of the user and ask whether the look and feel is right. Bring back what they confirmed and any change they want.", "Build the data layer and routes to the spec, reading and writing through the contract settled upstream and driving refreshes with the call contract from the model-call node. Leave the page alone; another node wires it. Hand back the routes and what each returns.", "Replace the mock with the real page on those routes, keeping the confirmed look exactly. Verify the app serves and renders, and surface its tab. Leave hardening and thorough tests to the handoff.", "Put the working site in front of the user and ask whether it does what they wanted. Bring back their answer.", "Hand the finished app to crystallize-creation with type=app."]
access list = [[], [], [], [0, 1], [0, 3], [4], [0, 2], [5, 6], [7], [8]]
</output>
```

One more, for "chart my running times from the CSVs I export". The boundaries
here are different in kind: one node may read the user's files but change none
of them, one settles a question while explicitly leaving a neighbouring question
alone, one builds against a fixed sample with the real loading stubbed out, and
one is told to hand a problem back rather than design around it.

```
<output>
capability = ["medium", "high", "medium", "high", "interactive", "medium", "interactive", "medium"]
subtasks = ["Work out what the user's exports actually contain, from real files they already have. Read them and change none of them, and leave any file that does not parse alone rather than repairing it. Hand back a small sample covering a normal export and the messiest one you found, and the shape a loader should hand the page.", "Settle what the chart shows and how the page around it reads, and hand back a short spec of the states it must cover, including having no data yet. Decide nothing about how files reach the page beyond the shape settled upstream.", "Build the page against the sample, driving every state in the spec from it, with loading left as a stub that raises rather than reading anything real. Hand back the page and what the stub expects to be handed.", "Build the real loading of the user's exports to the shape settled upstream, behind the same contract the stub stands in for. Do not touch the page. If a real export breaks an assumption the sample did not, hand that back rather than widening the shape to absorb it.", "Put the mock in front of the user and ask whether the look and feel is right. Bring back what they confirmed and any change they want.", "Swap the stub for the real loader, verify the app serves and renders against real exports, and surface its tab. Keep the confirmed look; if the swap surfaces a mismatch, hand it back rather than reshaping the page around it.", "Put the working site in front of the user and ask whether it does what they wanted. Bring back their answer.", "Hand the finished app to crystallize-creation with type=app."]
access list = [[], [], [0, 1], [0, 1], [2], [3, 4], [5], [6]]
</output>
```

All three lists are the same length: one entry per node, in order.
