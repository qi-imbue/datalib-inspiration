"""Resident in-workspace collector for bug-report diagnostics.

Invoked by the minds desktop app via a small ``mngr exec`` as
``python3 system/scripts/collect_bug_report_diagnostics.py [--logs]
[--transcript] [--scan-timeout=<seconds>]``. Stdlib only (no venv, no
third-party imports), targeting the container's system python3 (3.11+).

Prints exactly one line -- the base64 of a zip -- and nothing at all when no
content type was requested. Under --logs the zip holds ``metadata.json`` plus
one ``logs/<program>.log`` member per collected service log, and one
``agent-logs/<agent-name>/<file>`` per harness log -- services run under
supervisord and agents run under tmux, so the two halves come from different
places and neither sees the other's failures. A harness that keeps a structured
log database rather than a text log (codex's app-server) contributes it too,
rendered to text as ``agent-logs/<agent-name>/<db>.log``. Under --transcript it
holds one ``chats/<agent-name>-<harness>.jsonl`` per selected agent
conversation, newest first. With BOTH flags each running agent also contributes
an ``agent-logs/<agent-name>/pane.txt``: a TUI harness renders the conversation
into its pane, so its scrollback needs the chats consent as well as the logs
one. The workspace logs, the harness logs, the log databases and the chats are
each scanned and released or withheld on their own. Anything requested that is
not in the archive whole -- a class withheld by the secret scan, or one the size
budget could not fit -- is a plain-words line in the archive's own
``collection-notes.txt`` member, so the archive explains itself; a content type
that was not requested appears in neither the members nor the notes.

Nothing leaves the container unscanned: every chat, the logs text, and each
future zip member's own filename are staged as PLAINTEXT and run through the
template's own secret-scan gate before anything is packed. A scanner pointed
at compressed bytes matches nothing and reports clean, which would turn the
archive into a way around the scan, so the scan always happens first.
