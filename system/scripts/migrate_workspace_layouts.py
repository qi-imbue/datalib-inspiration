"""Carry a workspace's projects, arrangements, titles, recency, and file-viewer locations
from the old per-agent layout files into the shell's state files, once.

The old layout store lives under the state directory of the agent the system interface ran
as (``$MNGR_HOST_DIR/agents/<agent-id>/workspace_layout/``; that agent is the services
agent, which the bootstrap runs as too) and names things by per-kind refs
(``chat:<agent-id>``, ``terminal:<name>``, ``service:files?instance=files-2``, ...).
The shell reads ``data/.state/system_interface/`` and names everything by address
(``app:<name>``, ``app:<name>?instance=<key>``). This script maps the one onto the other:

- ``projects_meta.json`` becomes ``projects.json`` (tab sets and rail shortcuts);
- each ``projects/<id>.json`` and ``<id>.mobile.json`` becomes the view's
  ``layouts/<id>/seed.desktop.json`` and ``seed.mobile.json``, the arrangement a client that
  has never visited the view starts from, with every panel renamed to a fresh tab id and every
  panel that maps to nothing (a launcher, a subagent view, an ad-hoc URL page) pruned;
- every file viewer found gets a record in the files app's store, at the folder it was showing;
- every terminal found gets a record in the terminal app's store, with the title it was given,
  so the terminal app lists it (and the shell keeps its tabs) before its tmux session exists
  again;
- ``migrated.json`` marks the run so it never runs twice.

Subcommands: ``run`` (the default; writes) and ``plan`` (prints what a run would write,
``--json`` for the machine-readable form). Standard-library only, like the other scripts
here, and never destructive: the old directory is left untouched, an output that already
exists is skipped (a projects file that holds projects or cannot be read, any seed;
``--force`` overwrites the projects file and the seeds), the two app stores only ever gain
records, and one unreadable view costs that view and nothing else. A workspace
with no old directory is marked migrated at once, so a fresh workspace is never "unmigrated".

The old directory is the one under the agent the environment names when that agent has one
(the boot-time run, as the services agent); otherwise it is whichever agent of the host has
one, since the update apply runs the script as a chat agent whose own state directory never
held a store. Several such agents are ambiguous: the run says so and writes nothing, not
even the marker, so a later run can be pointed at the right one with ``--source``.
