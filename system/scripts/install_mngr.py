"""Install the vendored mngr as a uv tool, with the plugins the manifest assigns it.

The base package and its plugins go in ONE ``uv tool install``. Installing the base alone
rebuilds the tool environment from that package and drops every extra, so an install
followed by a separate ``mngr plugin add`` leaves the tool plugin-less in between -- and a
run that dies in that window leaves it that way for good. Such an mngr cannot resolve
``[agent_types.claude]``, so ``mngr create --template chat`` fails on the ``chat``
template's ``output_style``; that create is how the desktop app starts an update, so the
workspace stops being updatable from the app at all.

This exists as a program rather than a documented command line because every hazard in it
is a shell hazard: an empty plugin list that ``set -e`` cannot see because the substitution
that produced it swallowed the lister's exit status, an install that lands under the wrong
``$HOME`` because uv's tool directories follow it, strict mode leaking into whatever shell
sourced the pin. None of those survive being written in Python, and a program can be
tested where a snippet in AGENTS.md cannot.

The update apply does its own install (``update_environment._reinstall_tool``) and is not
a caller: it unions the extras already in the tool's receipt with the manifest's, which is
how a release that adds a plugin reaches a workspace that predates it. That is a different
operation, not a copy of this one.
