"""Snapshot a Modal sandbox that already has a minds workspace + Docker
container provisioned, so test runs can boot from that state nearly
instantly via offload's ``--override-image-id`` flag.

This is the standing producer for the ``minds_snapshot_resume`` test stage:
the ``build-minds-snapshot`` CI job runs it on every PR to mint a fresh
snapshot image, and ``test-minds-snapshot`` then fans the
``minds_snapshot_resume`` suite (``apps/minds/test_snapshot_resume.py``)
out against it. See ``apps/minds/docs/testing-overview.md`` (section on the
modal-snapshot stage) for the full picture.

To run the suite yourself:

1. Mint a snapshot image id (multi-minute; needs Modal credentials):
       uv run python scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py
   The image id (``im-...``) is printed at the end. CI mints its own per
   run, so ids are throwaway -- never hardcode one.
2. Run the whole suite, or a single test, against it:
       just test-offload-minds-snapshot <image-id>
       just test-offload-minds-snapshot <image-id> '--filter <test_name>'

The ``/app -> /code/mngr`` symlink layered in below matters: offload's
``--override-image-id`` path hardcodes ``workdir="/app"`` on the resumed
sandbox, and the symlink is what lets ``uv run pytest`` find the project
from offload's chosen workdir.

The flow is:

1. Build a Modal image with the full Electron e2e toolchain: Python + uv +
   Docker-in-Docker + Node + pnpm + xvfb + Playwright, plus the local mngr
   repo source.
2. Create a Modal sandbox with ``experimental_options={"vm_runtime": True}``
   -- Modal's true-VM runtime. We need this specifically because
   Docker-in-sandbox state (everything in ``/var/lib/docker``, including
   the agent's container and image layers) only persists across a
   ``snapshot_filesystem()`` call inside a VM-runtime sandbox.
3. Inside the sandbox, start ``dockerd`` and invoke
   ``imbue.minds.desktop_client.e2e_workspace_runner.create_workspace_via_electron``
   directly (no pytest). The runner is the shared driver behind the
   minds Electron e2e test -- driving the Electron UI to create a
   default-workspace-template workspace -- but we call it WITHOUT the
   ``mngr destroy`` cleanup the pytest test wraps it with, so the agent
   and its Docker container survive into the snapshot.
4. Call ``sandbox.snapshot_filesystem()`` to capture the resulting state
   and print the Modal image ID so it can be plumbed into offload as
   ``offload run --override-image-id <ID>``.

We do NOT switch the general mngr_modal provider to ``vm_runtime``: the
rest of mngr does not need a true VM, so this remains scoped to the
snapshot workflow only.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py
    uv run python scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py --app-name custom-app
    uv run python scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py --skip-workspace-creation  # bare image, no agent

The script intentionally lives outside the regular test suite -- it's
expensive (multi-minute), it requires Modal credentials, and it produces a
snapshot ID that the test stage then references (CI re-derives one per run;
operators mint one manually for local iteration).

# rsync exclusion list applied when staging the local mngr checkout into a
