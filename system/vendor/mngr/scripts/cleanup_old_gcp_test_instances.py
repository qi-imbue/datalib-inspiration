"""Script to clean up old GCP test GCE instances.

This script is run by a CI job (on every push to main and pull request) to
delete GCE instances created by the mngr_gcp release tests that were left
behind when a test session was killed before its in-process cleanup
(``pytest_sessionfinish`` in ``libs/mngr_gcp/imbue/mngr_gcp/conftest.py``)
could run. It selects instances by the ``mngr-pytest-launched=true`` label that
``GcpVpsClient.create_instance`` attaches to every pytest-launched instance and
deletes those whose ``mngr-created-at`` instance metadata (which
``create_instance`` stamps on every instance, since GCE labels cannot hold an
ISO timestamp) is older than ``--max-age-hours``. Production instances never
carry the pytest-launched label, so they are never touched.

Skips silently (exit 0) when GCP credentials or a default project cannot be
resolved, so it is safe to wire into CI before the secret is configured.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_old_gcp_test_instances.py [--max-age-hours HOURS]

Options:
    --max-age-hours  Maximum age in hours for test instances to keep (default: 1.0)
