"""Publish every channel manifest declared in ``apps/minds/release-channels.toml``.

The file is the desired state and this makes it so, which is what turns a
promotion into a reviewable pull request: CI dry-runs this on the PR, so a
reviewer sees whether the change would actually publish, and merging is what
applies it.

A channel is moved by repointing its entry, never by removing it: nothing here
deletes an object, so a channel whose entry is gone keeps serving whatever it
last published. That divergence is reported rather than corrected -- dropping
``<channel>-mac.yml`` would leave every client on that channel erroring against a
feed that serves nothing.

``manifest.py`` stays the single-channel primitive; this reads the file, checks
each entry against reality, and calls it.

The same file's ``[web_channels.<channel>]`` entries -- the template tag
browser-created workspaces pin to -- publish beside the desktop manifests as
``<channel>-web.json`` through ``web_channels.py``, under the same
dry-run / no-op / undeclared-channel reporting.
