"""Cleanup for the minds-snapshot Modal images built by
``scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py``.

``sandbox.snapshot_filesystem()`` images persist until explicitly deleted,
and Modal exposes no list-images API. So this script keeps a durable ledger
of built image ids in a Modal ``Dict`` (``image_id -> created-at unix
timestamp``) and uses Modal's ``ImageDelete`` RPC to remove them. Three
modes, matching the CI lifecycle:

- ``record <image_id>``: add a freshly-built image to the ledger. Run by the
  ``build-minds-snapshot`` CI job right after the build, so every built image
  is tracked even if the run never reaches the delete step.
- ``delete <image_id>``: delete the image and drop it from the ledger. Run by
  the ``test-minds-snapshot`` CI job on success -- the steady-state path that
  keeps things clean after every green run.
- ``sweep --max-age-hours H``: delete (and drop) every ledger entry older than
  H hours. Run by the periodic ``cleanup-modal-environments`` CI job as the
  safety net for leaked images whose run never reached the delete step. Mirrors
  the name+age sweep that ``cleanup_old_modal_test_environments.py`` does for
  Modal test environments.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_modal_snapshot_images.py record im-01...
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_modal_snapshot_images.py delete im-01...
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_modal_snapshot_images.py sweep --max-age-hours 1.0

Requires Modal credentials (MODAL_TOKEN_ID / MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET, or an active
Modal profile). The ledger Dict and the images live in whatever Modal
environment those credentials resolve to, so record/delete/sweep must all run
with the same credentials -- which they do in CI.

    client, so a Dict op done first leaves that singleton bound to the
    background loop and the subsequent `ImageDelete` hangs ("RPC made outside
    of task context"). Resetting the cached client makes `from_env()` build a

    closes it afterward so the loop tears down cleanly and the next Dict op
    rebuilds its own client. Keep all ledger (Dict) operations either before
