"""Tests for the CI wiring around ``scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py``.

``offload-modal-minds-snapshot.toml`` scopes offload's test discovery to an
explicit list of paths (``[framework].paths``) because collecting the whole
monorepo just to find the ``minds_snapshot_resume`` tests cost ~90s on every
CI run. The correctness risk of scoping is that a snapshot-resume test added
in a NEW file would silently never be discovered (and thus never run) in CI.
The test below pins the config's path list to exactly the set of test files
that apply the mark, so that drift fails loudly here instead.

The remaining tests pin the dependency-manifest staging used to make the
snapshot image's third-party-install layers cacheable across CI runs: the
python manifests tree must cover every uv workspace member's pyproject.toml
(a missing member manifest breaks the manifests-only
``uv sync --no-install-workspace`` layer), and the pnpm tree must contain
exactly what ``pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`` reads.

Finally, the in-sandbox runner program (a Python program held in a string and
executed via ``python -c`` inside the sandbox) is compile-checked, so a syntax
error in it fails here instead of after the multi-minute image build in CI.
