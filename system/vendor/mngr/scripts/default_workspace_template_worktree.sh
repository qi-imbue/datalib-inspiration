# Turn the code-guardian gates back on for this checkout. The committed
# .reviewer/settings.json carries the *workspace* policy -- every gate off, no
# auto-merge or push -- because that repo is also cloned into containers, where
# a workspace is the user's own isolated unit. A checkout nested here is the
# opposite case: active development of the template, which mngr's root
# .reviewer/settings.json declares as a second reviewed repo, and which should
# be gated exactly like mngr itself. settings.local.json is gitignored there
# and wins per-key, so the workspace policy stays intact upstream, and a
# container can never inherit these values (creation clones the branch, and
# this file is never committed).
#
# system/vendor/mngr is exempted from the clean-tree gate: `just
# sync-vendor-mngr-live` (which `just minds-start` runs at launch) and
# `propagate-changes` rsync the live mngr tree into that tracked subtree,
# deliberately leaving thousands of uncommitted files behind, and that
# machine-generated state is byte-identical to a deliberate revendor -- no
# gate can tell them apart. Review of that content is owned by the mngr repo
# (whatever legitimately lands there came from an mngr PR with its own gates),
# and a DWT PR missing a revendor it depends on fails its own CI. Everything
# else in the checkout keeps the clean-tree gate.
