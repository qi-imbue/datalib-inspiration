"""Script to clean up old Azure test VMs (and orphaned NICs / public IPs).

This script is run by a CI job (on every push to main and pull request) to
delete Azure VMs created by the mngr_azure release tests that were left behind
when a test session was killed before its in-process cleanup
(``pytest_sessionfinish`` in ``libs/mngr_azure/imbue/mngr_azure/conftest.py``)
could run. It selects VMs by the ``mngr-pytest-launched=true`` tag that
``AzureVpsClient.create_instance`` attaches to every pytest-launched VM and
deletes those whose ``mngr-created-at`` tag is older than ``--max-age-hours``.
Production VMs never carry that tag, so they are never touched. Unattached
pytest-launched NICs / public IPs from capacity-failed creates are reclaimed
in the same pass.

Skips silently (exit 0) when Azure credentials or a subscription cannot be
resolved, so it is safe to wire into CI before the secret is configured.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_old_azure_test_instances.py [--max-age-hours HOURS]

Options:
    --max-age-hours  Maximum age in hours for test VMs to keep (default: 1.0)
