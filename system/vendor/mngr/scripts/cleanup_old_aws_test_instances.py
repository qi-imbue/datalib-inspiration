"""Script to clean up old AWS test EC2 instances.

This script is run by a CI job (on every push to main and pull request) to
terminate EC2 instances created by the mngr_aws release tests that were left
behind when a test session was killed before its in-process cleanup
(``pytest_sessionfinish`` in ``libs/mngr_aws/imbue/mngr_aws/conftest.py``)
could run. It selects instances by the ``mngr-pytest-launched=true`` tag that
``AwsVpsClient.create_instance`` attaches to every pytest-launched instance and
terminates those whose ``mngr-created-at`` tag (which ``create_instance``
stamps on every instance) is older than ``--max-age-hours``. Production
instances never carry the pytest-launched tag, so they are never touched.

Skips silently (exit 0) when AWS credentials cannot be resolved, so it is safe
to wire into CI before the secret is configured.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/cleanup_old_aws_test_instances.py [--max-age-hours HOURS]

Options:
    --max-age-hours  Maximum age in hours for test instances to keep (default: 1.0)
