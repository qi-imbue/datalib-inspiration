# Changelog - dev

A concise, human-friendly summary of changes for repo-level dev tooling: CI workflows, repo scripts, top-level configuration, build tooling, ratchets, and the changelog tooling itself. Entries are categorized using the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

For the full, unedited changelog entries, see [UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md](UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Changed: The TMR workflow no longer opens the run's pull request itself — the reducer agent does, so the PR description can carry the run's actual findings (mapper status breakdown, escalations table). The workflow now passes the reducer (and only the reducer) `GH_TOKEN` plus the context to write that description (repository, base branch, run URL, periodic-run label/assignees) via the new `--reducer-env` option; mappers do not receive the token. The only PR-related step left in the workflow is the breadcrumb comment linking a superseded periodic PR to its replacement, which reads the new PR's URL from a `pull_request_url` event the orchestrator emits.

## 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added: Three dev skills under `.claude/skills/` — `post-pr-to-slack` (announce this repo's PRs in `#project-minds-internal-product` with a one-line message and mark the announcement `:merged:` when the PR merges), `crispy-comments` (prune code comments on the current branch down to what helps future maintainers), and `address-pr-comments` (apply `CLAUDE:`/`SCULPTOR:`-prefixed PR comments, and critically evaluate feedback from automated reviewers against the repo's conventions and the PR's goals rather than following it blindly).
- Added: Concise implementation plan under `blueprint/login-auth-flow-polish/` describing the Minds OAuth login-flow UX improvements (button spinner/fade, staged status messaging, raise-window-on-success, in-page error handling).

### Removed

- Removed: The root `.minds/policies/` directory (and its `.gitignore` un-ignore block). The minds-tier Vault ACL policy text now lives in the imbue-ai/vault repo's terraform (`terraform/employee.tf` and `terraform/minds_operators.tf`), the single source of truth — keeping a second copy here is what let the live policies drift from the vault repo's config in the first place.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `test_no_gitignored_files_are_tracked` now skips files that are deleted in the working tree. Offload sandboxes reconstruct branch state as a base commit plus an unstaged diff, which made the test misfire on commits that delete files and gitignore their path at the same time.

## 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added: `scripts/current_branch.sh` — shared jj-robust current-branch helper reused by `just default-workspace-template-worktree`, `just sync-vendor-mngr`, `just minds-start`, and the Claude Code status line, replacing open-coded `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (which yields `HEAD` under jj colocated checkouts).

### Changed

- Changed: `minds-dev-workflow` skill's first-time bootstrap now activates with `--create --deploy` (was `--create`, which failed the documented `minds env deploy` one-liner), spells out the `vault login` + `~/.modal.toml` prerequisites, and Quick start points to the new `apps/minds/docs/dev-setup.md`.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `just default-workspace-template-worktree` no longer fails with `fatal: 'HEAD' is not a valid branch name` under jj colocated checkouts (falls back to jj's nearest bookmark to `@` when git HEAD is detached).
- Fixed: `just minds-start` now fails fast with an actionable message when `rsync` is Apple's openrsync (recent macOS `/usr/bin/rsync`, which lacks the `--filter=':- .gitignore'` GNU feature the vendor/mngr sync needs), and its "no minds env activated" error suggests the correct env name form `dev-<user>` (was `<user>-dev`, which the env-name regex rejects).

## 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added: `uv.lock` pins `urwid-readline`, a new dependency the kanpan board uses for readline-style editing in its agent-reply input.

### Changed

- Changed: `ci.yml`'s `test-minds-release` job installs `openssh-server` and sets `MNGR_LATCHKEY_E2E_TESTS=1` before the plain-minds-release step, opting in the new `apps/minds/test_latchkey_e2e.py` release test (which runs a throwaway root sshd on the runner to fake a VPS outer host; gated behind an explicit opt-in that only this throwaway-runner job sets).

## 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added: `specs/workspace-sync/spec.md` — design record for end-to-end-encrypted cross-device sync of workspace metadata and secrets (workspace records on the connector, per-account DEKs wrapped by the master password, metadata-only tier for empty passwords, and the one-shot migration off the legacy local files). Plus `specs/workspace-sync/remote-access.md` (how synced SSH material is materialized so cloud workspaces are fully accessible from any unlocked installation) and the planning blueprint at `blueprint/remote-workspace-ssh-access/`.

### Changed

- Changed: `test-minds-snapshot` CI job (on `run_minds_release_tests` runs) now resolves the per-run CI env's coordinates and SuperTokens admin secrets and forwards them into the offload sandbox as `MINDS_SYNC_E2E_*` env vars so the new workspace-sync e2e tests can target the real connector.

## 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added: `just default-workspace-template-worktree` (short alias `just dwt-worktree`) creates an independent default-workspace-template checkout at `.external_worktrees/default-workspace-template` on the current mngr branch, needing no configuration. Errors if a checkout is already there or if the branch already exists on default-workspace-template. Optional `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE_DIR` (from a gitignored `apps/minds/.env` or shell) accelerates the clone via `git clone --reference-if-able --dissociate`. Removes the hardcoded `~/project/default-workspace-template` guidance elsewhere: the `minds-start` recipe and `minds-dev-workflow` skill point at the new recipe, and `bake-slice-dev` resolves its workspace dir from the arg, else `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE_DIR`, else the `.external_worktrees/default-workspace-template` checkout.
- Added: `.mngr/settings.toml` copies the gitignored `apps/minds/.env` into each mngr agent worktree (via `work_dir_extra_paths`), so agents inherit the operator's `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE_DIR` speed hint. Skipped silently when the file is absent.
- Added: Portable-shell section in `style_guide.md` — commands passed to a host's `execute_*` methods run under the host's own userland (BSD on macOS local, GNU on Linux remotes), with validated portable forms for the cases mngr has hit: `du -sk` over `du -sb`, `stat -c … || stat -f …`, a forward scan over `tac`/`tail -r`, and a perl `alarm` form (with its two pitfalls) for bounding a sub-command where `timeout(1)` is unavailable.
- Added: Blueprints for `electron-log-and-crash-page/`, `observe-pid-watch/`, `dockview-named-layouts/`, `robust-message-delivery/`, and `minds-inspirations/`.

### Changed

- Changed: The `mngr` dev shim (`scripts/mngr`) now runs `uv run --all-packages`, so pulling a commit that adds a dependency to an mngr plugin no longer breaks the `mngr` command until `uv sync --all-packages` is run by hand. Plugins are editable workspace installs, so a previously-registered entry point survived across pulls while a newly-declared dependency stayed missing — breaking *every* subcommand (since mngr imports every entry point at startup), not just the plugin's own. No measurable startup cost when the venv is already up to date.
- Changed: Bumped the pinned Claude Code CLI version from 2.1.160 to 2.1.207 in CI workflows (`release-tests.yml`, `tmr-setup` action) and the minds e2e snapshot script, matching the new workspace pin that supports Claude Fable 5.
- Changed: Added `claude-fable-5` with inline pricing ($10 / $50 per 1M input / output tokens, cache write 1.25e-5, cache read 1e-6) to the repo-root local-dev LiteLLM proxy config (`litellm_proxy/config.yaml`), kept in sync with `apps/modal_litellm/app.py` by a drift test.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Corrected `specs/common-transcript-standard/spec.md` — marked it implemented (Tier 1 + Tier 2 landed in `90ef7a979`, 2026-06-15) and rewrote the Compatibility section, which wrongly claimed common transcripts are "continuously re-derived from the raw stream." They are not — `convert()` dedups by `event_id` and only appends, so assistant lines from a pre-`parts[]` emitter render `(no content)` under the `parts[]`-only reader. The flat-field reader fallback is a back-compat shim, not a fix for a broken emitter.

## 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added: `blueprint/mngr-forward-http2/` — implementation plan for terminating TLS and negotiating HTTP/2 at the `mngr forward` proxy so the workspace UI is no longer capped by Chromium's per-origin HTTP/1.1 connection limit.
- Added: `blueprint/imbue-cloud-sticky-agent-labels/plan-imbue-cloud-sticky-agent-labels.md` — design plan for the imbue_cloud "husk" fix (persisting and re-attaching last-known agent identity so a transiently-unreachable leased workspace keeps its labels instead of collapsing to a label-less stub). Implementation lands in `libs/mngr_imbue_cloud`.
- Added: `blueprint/forward-services-cache/` — spec for the `mngr_forward` fast-first-load fix (persist the resolver's per-agent service map to disk and seed from it at startup so a restored remote-mind window resolves at ~3s instead of the measured ~50s cold-stream wait, with the live `mngr event` stream as the correction path). Implementation ships on the same branch under `libs/mngr_forward/`.

### Changed

- Changed: The minds e2e snapshot build (`scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`) now pins the create default to runc via `MINDS_DOCKER_RUNTIME_DEFAULT=RUNC`. The Modal snapshot sandbox has no gVisor, and the per-create runtime feature otherwise defaults the Linux create form to runsc and stacks the `docker_runsc` template, so the build's workspace creation failed with "unknown or invalid runtime name: runsc". The previous `MNGR__PROVIDERS__DOCKER__DOCKER_RUNTIME=runc` override could not fix this (an explicitly stacked template's docker_runtime outranks a provider-config env var in mngr's create-settings precedence) and was removed as redundant.

## 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added: `scripts/rename_template_repo.py` — migration tool that renames the forever-claude-template repo to a new name. All case forms (kebab, snake, SNAKE_UPPER, Title, Pascal) are derived from `--new-name`; `--new-abbreviation` sets the shorthand that replaces `fct`/`FCT` (context-sensitive across snake, kebab, and CamelCase identifiers). Dry-run by default; `--apply` edits in place idempotently, `--check` verifies no live references remain (including CamelCase-embedded forms), `--show-diff` prints unified diffs. Historical records (changelog entries, `specs/`, `blueprint/`), vendored trees, and lockfiles are reported but never rewritten.
- Added: `scripts/migrate_state_fct_to_default_workspace_template.sh` — developer-local state migration for the template rename (stale `.external_worktrees` removal, template checkout dir rename, git remote URLs, `apps/minds/.env` var rename, `__pycache__` sweep). Dry-run flag, idempotent; reports anything it is unsure about instead of touching it.

### Changed

- Changed: Repo-wide rename of forever-claude-template to default-workspace-template (justfile, CI workflows, scripts, Claude skills), applied mechanically by the new rename tool. The GitHub repo rename itself happens out of band.

## 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added: `specs/discovery-log-cleanup.md` — plan for cleaning up discovery logging and provider treatment in the Minds app (once-per-process suppression of repeated provider-level discovery-error warnings in the three stream consumers, startup snapshots from `mngr observe --discovery-only` for skipped providers, always-write `[providers.aws-<region>]` blocks preserving `is_enabled`, and bouncing the observe child when the bootstrap's settings write changes the provider set).
- Added: `blueprint/minds-inspirations/` — implementation plan and feature prompt for the minds "inspirations" feature. Inspirations let a running mind publish a clean, bootable snapshot of the apps it built to a new GitHub repo, and let another mind adapt one into itself. The plan records the design evolution: assembly delegated to a launch-task worker on an isolated worktree with a strict no-merge-back invariant, inline-chat confirmation, latchkey GitHub permissioning end-to-end (REST API calls via latchkey curl and the git push through the latchkey gateway's native git smart-HTTP proxying), a bespoke-thumbnail gate, and the incident fixes (destructive-merge data loss, `GH_TOKEN` shadowing, base-ref resolution on multi-root repos, welcome takeover). The implementation itself lives in `forever-claude-template` on the companion branch.

## 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added: `just list-servers` and `just prep-server <server-id>` recipes wrapping the new env-aware `minds server {list,prep}` commands (DSN + pool SSH key resolved from the activated tier automatically). The `minds-justfile` skill doc was updated to match.
- Added: `specs/backup-update-fixes/concise.md` and `specs/injected-backup-service/concise.md` — plans for the per-workspace backup health route (with master-password hash + rotation, fixed minimum backup version, `official` remote, snapshot-resume test rewrite) and the drift-detection + one-click converging update on running workspaces.

### Changed

- Changed: `destroy-pool-host` justfile recipe renamed to `destroy-pool-hosts` and now takes any number of pool-host ids (clean break, no alias). Forwards to `minds pool destroy`, which destroys all named slices in parallel after atomically claiming each row so a user lease cannot race the destroy. The `minds-justfile` skill doc was updated to match.
- Changed: Pre-commit `regenerate-cli-docs` hook now also triggers on plugin CLI files (`libs/mngr_*/imbue/**/cli/*.py`), so editing a plugin's click commands can no longer leave the generated `libs/mngr/docs/commands/` reference stale until an unrelated PR trips the check.
- Changed: `scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`'s docs no longer hardcode stale snapshot image ids or describe the script as a one-off prototype — it is documented as the standing producer for the `build-minds-snapshot` CI stage, with instructions for minting an image id manually and running individual tests against it via `just test-offload-minds-snapshot <image-id> '--filter <test_name>'`.

## 2026-07-08

### Added

- Added: `just tmr-mngr` and `just tmr-minds` recipes as the canonical per-suite flag sets for `mngr tmr` (the TMR workflow inputs mirror them). The minds recipe targets the `apps/minds` tree with the minds-tailored mapper prompt and defaults to the plain `@release` tests; the capability suites (snapshot/deployment/services) are documented as extra args needing their own secrets and setup.
- Added: `tmr-minds-scheduled.yml` — the daily scheduled TMR run is split into two independent per-variant wrappers. `tmr-mngr-scheduled.yml` (renamed from the single `tmr-scheduled.yml`, at 08:00 UTC) and `tmr-minds-scheduled.yml` (09:00 UTC) each own a gate label (`tmr-mngr-periodic` / `tmr-minds-periodic`), concurrency group, and periodic PR, so the two suites schedule and review independently. The gate policy (auto-close a periodic PR older than 4 days, else skip) moved into a shared reusable workflow `tmr-gate.yml`, and `tmr.yml` gained a `periodic_label` input to route each variant's PR to its own gate.

### Changed

- Changed: `.github/workflows/tmr.yml` accepts `name`, `mapper_prompt`, and `reducer_prompt` inputs, so a dispatch can run a named TMR variant (e.g. `tmr-minds` over `apps/minds`) with its own branch/agent prefix and optional prompt-template overrides.
- Changed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` freezes its `commit_sha` (mngr) and `template_ref` (forever-claude-template) inputs to full SHAs exactly once, in `check_should_run`, at run start. Inputs accept a full 40-char SHA, branch, or tag; every downstream job consumes the frozen SHAs instead of re-resolving. Fixes a race where a `template_ref=main` run could test a different FCT commit than the one recorded in the green marker and slack message (agent creation used the raw ref, resolved ~15-45 min after the pair-key fingerprint). Also cleaned up the workflow file (net -135 lines): deduplicated ref resolution into a single `resolve_ref` function, looped the ToDesktop secrets check, and replaced the hardcoded screenshot-prefix list in the summary manifest with a sorted glob. Caveat: SHAs must be full 40-hex and reachable from some ref; FCT-SHA creates need a binary built from mngr `02bb71b44` (2026-06-11) or later.

## 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Changed: Migrated GitHub Actions workflows off GitHub-stored secrets onto HashiCorp Vault via the `imbue-ai/use-vault-secrets` OIDC action. CI test/TMR jobs fetch the Anthropic key, imbue Modal token id/secret, and TMR S3 credentials from `mngr/ci/*` (role `mngr_ci_gh`); the minds CI-env jobs fetch the minds-dev Modal token from `minds/ci/*`; `minds-launch-to-msg.yml`'s build job fetches ToDesktop signing credentials from an environment-gated `minds/release/*` (role `minds_release_gh`, GitHub Environment `minds-release`). `scripts/changelog_deploy.sh` now reads its bot token from `secrets/mngr/dev/GH_TOKEN` and Anthropic key from `secrets/mngr/ci/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` repo variable and the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` / `MINDS_DEV_MODAL_TOKEN_*` / `AWS_*` Actions secrets are retired. The self-hosted macOS `minds-runner` needs `curl` and `jq` on PATH for the Vault action.

## 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added: Design plans for overlay-surface + custom tooltips (`blueprint/overlay-surface-tooltips/`), per-provider discovery (`blueprint/per-provider-discovery/`, plus follow-up spec `spec-bounded-per-host-discovery.md`), persistent terminals (`blueprint/persistent-terminals/`), the SIGWINCH attach-hook implementation (`specs/sigwinch-attach-hook/spec.md`), and simplifying workspace names (`blueprint/simplify-workspace-names/`).
- Added: Paired forever-claude-template worktree in the minds snapshot bake — `scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py` now materializes the FCT branch matching the current mngr branch (else `main`) with the current mngr vendored into `vendor/mngr`, baked into the snapshot image via a separate upload. Workspace-creation tests now exercise coordinated mngr+FCT changes together instead of the released FCT tag. `just minds-test-electron` materializes the worktree before the local run.

### Changed

- Changed: Raised the repo-wide bash strict-mode ratchet from 11 to 12 (`test_meta_ratchets.py::test_prevent_bash_without_strict_mode`) to account for `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/resources/sigwinch_panes.sh`, a best-effort tmux repaint sweep that deliberately uses `set -uo pipefail` (omitting `-e`). Refreshed the test's stale docstring.
- Changed: Excluded `/imbue_common/sentry` from coverage.

## 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added: `blueprint/ratchet-async-await/` design doc for the new monorepo-wide async/await ratchet that freezes and gradually reduces `async def` / `await` usage.

### Changed

- Changed: Split the mngr and minds release test suites. `.github/workflows/release-tests.yml` jobs renamed (`test-docker-release` -> `test-mngr-release-docker`, `test-release` -> `test-mngr-release`) and now exclude `apps/minds` by path. All minds `@release` tests (`minds_deployment` group plus the plain minds `@release` tests, with Chromium installed in-job) now run from the minds release job (`test-minds-release` in `ci.yml`, manual `run_minds_release_tests` dispatch) instead of the mngr `v*`-tag workflow. Updated the stale `test-docker-release` reference in `offload-modal-release.toml`.
- Changed: Bumped pinned Claude Code CLI version 2.1.141 -> 2.1.160 in the release-tests workflow, the `tmr-setup` action, and the minds snapshot build script, aligning with the release Dockerfile pin.

### Removed

- Removed: Dev-level OVH-VPS scaffolding. Dropped `--backend slice` from the `bake-slice-{dev,prod}` justfile recipes (the flag no longer exists) and reframed the pool recipe comments to slice-only; deleted the unused `scripts/remove_old_flat_vault_secrets.py`; and removed obsolete `specs/swap-pool-to-ovh/`, `blueprint/deprecate-ovh-vps/`, and `blueprint/disable-ovh-qemu-backups/`.

## 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added: Operator-run build + publish pipeline for the pre-baked Lima VM image (issue #2306). `scripts/build-lima-image.sh` + `scripts/lima_image/bake_provision.sh` bake the image with Lima itself (`vz` on Apple Silicon, accelerated QEMU on Linux) so the artifact is guaranteed Lima-bootable, and `scripts/lima_image/publish.py` chunks the raw image with `desync`, signs the per-release root manifest with `minisign`, and uploads chunks + index + signed manifest to Cloudflare R2 (content-addressed chunks already present are skipped). Replaces the stale Packer/QEMU pipeline (removed `scripts/packer/` and `scripts/publish-lima-image.sh`); implementation spec at `blueprint/lima-image-cache/`.
- Added: Updated `blueprint/minds-error-reporting-help/` design doc to record the phase-3 design — the in-workspace agent-help flow escalates by opening a pre-filled report modal for human review, the outer app spawns the `/assist` chat via `mngr create` against the workspace's container host, and `/update-self` gains a recognizable merge-commit convention.

### Changed

- Changed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` build timeouts raised — `pnpm dist` step 45 → 70 min and build job 60 → 85 min — so a fresh ToDesktop bundle (~43 min normal, ~60+ min with a slow source download) can finish without hitting the mid-notarize timeout that had been failing back-to-back scheduled runs. The 70/85 split preserves the ~15-min margin the post-failure cancel step needs.
- Changed: Slack notification's build link updated — the single `binary` link (pointing at the ToDesktop dashboard) becomes `todesktop(mac-arm64)`, where `todesktop` links to the dashboard build page and `mac-arm64` links to the arm64 `.dmg` download.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Scheduled TMR CI workflow's `tmr-setup` step (`ImportError: cannot import name 'find_user_claude_config'`). The pre-trust step now invokes a real module (`scripts/pretrust_claude_checkout.py`) instead of an inline Python heredoc, so future renames of the claude-config API are caught by `ty` rather than only at CI runtime.

## 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added: Blueprint planning document `blueprint/hostname-live-validation/` for live validation of the workspace-creation Name field.

## 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added: Per-run minds CI environment in the snapshot test pipeline. New `build-minds-ci-env` job deploys a `ci-*` env and publishes its per-run secrets to Vault; `test-minds-snapshot` runs `minds_services` live tests (login + mint LiteLLM key + live LLM call) against it; `destroy-minds-ci-env` (`always()`) tears it down, with a parallel `cleanup-minds-ci-envs` backstop sweeping leaked `ci-*` envs older than 1 hour. New Vault-OIDC `minds_ci_env_gh` / `minds_ci_test_gh` roles. Opt-in: standing up a `ci-*` env requires `workflow_dispatch` with `run_minds_release_tests=true`; normal pushes still run `minds_snapshot_resume` (needs only the snapshot image).
- Added: Manual release-tier CI job `test-minds-release` (same `run_minds_release_tests` switch) runs the heavy `minds_deployment` tests (deploy / rollback / round-trip), each minting and destroying its own ephemeral env.
- Added: `just minds-test-electron-flow` recipe drives the full minds Electron workspace lifecycle end-to-end under `xvfb` (create local Docker workspace -> chat round-trip -> terminal -> home -> v1 destroy), complementing the create-only `just minds-test-electron`.
- Added: `openapi-spec-validator` in the root dev dependency group; used to validate the minds `GET /api/schema` OpenAPI document in tests (test-only, not shipped in the minds wheel).
- Added: Design and blueprint documents — `blueprint/accelerate-slice-bake/plan-accelerate-slice-bake.md`, `blueprint/minds-workspace-api/plan-minds-workspace-api.md` + `HANDOFF.md`, `blueprint/minds-api-spectree/plan-minds-api-spectree.md`, and `blueprint/minds-api-route-consolidation/plan-minds-api-route-consolidation.md`.

### Changed

- Changed: Removed the dedicated `test-docker-electron` CI job and consolidated all Electron e2e coverage into `test-minds-snapshot`. The Electron create+chat test now carries the `minds_snapshot_resume` mark and runs in the snapshot offload sandbox, reusing the snapshot image's already-baked Electron/Playwright/Xvfb toolchain instead of cold-installing them on every push.
- Changed: Snapshot-test offload pin unified to `0.9.10`.
- Changed: Pinned the changelog-consolidation schedule's mngr `user_id` to a committed constant (`USER_ID` in `scripts/changelog_schedule_utils.py`, exposed via `--print-user-id`). `changelog_deploy.sh` and the `changelog-trigger` justfile recipe now export it as `MNGR_USER_ID`, so deploys and on-demand triggers always target the same Modal environment regardless of which machine runs them. Previously the environment name depended on a random per-profile `user_id`, so redeploying from a fresh checkout would silently fork the schedule into a new, empty environment.
- Changed: `just minds-start` no longer takes an `agent_name` argument or sets `MINDS_WORKSPACE_NAME`. Its parameters are now `branch` and `fct` (positional, in that order). The workspace gets an automatic `mind-N` name unless typed into the create form's advanced "Name" field — type a name there if you want a predictable handle for `just propagate-changes <name>` / `just forward-system-interface <name>`.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `just sync-vendor-mngr` now resolves the forever-claude-template path to an absolute path before use, so passing a relative path no longer breaks the recipe's second `cd`.

## 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added: Fast, realistic minds-workspace **snapshot test suite** wired into CI as two jobs. `build-minds-snapshot` builds a fresh Modal `vm_runtime` snapshot image (Docker-in-Docker + a real Electron-created forever-claude-template workspace, `docker stop`ped) once per run; `test-minds-snapshot` boots from that image via offload's `--override-image-id` and runs the `minds_snapshot_resume` suite. Both run on every PR (blocking), skip fork PRs, and have a one-click `DISABLE_MINDS_SNAPSHOT_CI` kill switch. Adds `scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`, `scripts/cleanup_modal_snapshot_images.py`, `offload-modal-minds-snapshot.toml`, and `just test-offload-minds-snapshot <image-id>`.
- Added: CI secrets now use the public `imbue-ai/use-vault-secrets` action (pinned by SHA); only `test-minds-snapshot` needs a secret (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Vault via OIDC).
- Added: Spec `specs/docstring-anchored-tmr.md` describing the overall move from tutorial-block-anchored to docstring-anchored TMR scope.
- Added: Blueprint plan `blueprint/minds-google-oauth-fallback/` for inserting a Minds-owned Google OAuth attempt between the credential-validity check and the self-setup browser flow.

### Changed

- Changed: Bumped the offload CI pin in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from `0.9.9` to `0.9.10` (cargo cache key, version check, and `cargo install` invocation updated to match).
- Changed: TMR workflow (`.github/workflows/tmr.yml`, including the daily scheduled run) now defaults to all of mngr's release tests (`libs/mngr` with `-m "release and not docker and not docker_sdk"`) rather than only the e2e tutorial subset. Docker-marked release tests are excluded because they need a real Docker daemon and run on a GitHub runner in `release-tests.yml`, not on the Modal hosts TMR provisions.
- Changed: `scripts/tutorial_matcher.py` now reads the tutorial block from each test function's docstring (under a `Tutorial block:` section) instead of from a `write_tutorial_block(...)` call. The `sync-tutorial-to-e2e-tests` skill now emits the docstring format (verbatim `Tutorial block:` section plus a `Scope:` section) and crystallizes the implicit requirements of each block's commands into the scope.
- Changed: Bash strict-mode ratchet (`test_meta_ratchets.py::test_prevent_bash_without_strict_mode`) now relies on `find_bash_scripts_without_strict_mode` skipping `.minds/template/` (declarative secret-schema templates, not runnable scripts). Recorded snapshot lowered from 17 to 11, pinned to the offload-CI count.
- Changed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` `macos_launch` job now checks out the trigger ref for the e2e harness (playwright spec + fixtures), matching `launch_to_msg`, instead of pinning the checkout to `commit_sha`. Previously `macos_launch` silently tested a stale harness while `launch_to_msg` picked up harness fixes on the dispatched branch. The binary under test is still pinned to `commit_sha` via the build artifact.
- Changed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` post-test cleanup step no longer swallows the reset script's exit code with `|| true`. The reset script now verifies the runner reached a clean state (no leaked Lima VM / `~/.minds` / app) after its best-effort cleanup and exits non-zero otherwise, so a cleanup failure that would silently rot the self-hosted runner now fails the job.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `scripts/remove_old_flat_vault_secrets.py` now treats a soft-deleted Vault secret (one whose latest version has a `deletion_time`, so `vault kv get` returns a null `data.data` rather than exit-2) as absent and skips it, instead of crashing the run.

## 2026-06-25

### Added

- Added: Blueprint planning document for the minds error-reporting & "get help" work (`blueprint/minds-error-reporting-help/`), scoping the full four-phase design (phases 1-2 implemented in this run; 3-4 will follow as stacked PRs).
- Added: Design doc `specs/tmr-bounded-convergence-and-normalization.md` for improving the e2e tests TMR generates — tutorial-anchored convergence with deletion as a first-class action, plus a suite-level normalization stage in the reducer and a FIXME-resolution/escalation lifecycle.
- Added: Design blueprint `blueprint/gateway-agent-id-validation/` documenting the decision to reject malformed permission-request `agent_id`s at the latchkey gateway instead of only guarding against them on the consumer side.

### Changed

- Changed: Bumped the offload CI pin in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from `0.9.7` to `0.9.9` (cargo cache key, version check, and `cargo install` invocation updated to match).
- Changed: `just minds-start` no longer defaults the workspace name to `mindtest`. Its `agent_name` argument defaults to empty, so a plain `just minds-start` leaves `MINDS_WORKSPACE_NAME` unset and the create form generates an automatic `mind-N` name — matching what a shipped binary does. Pass a name explicitly to pin it (a collision now errors at create time rather than being auto-suffixed).
- Changed: Nightly changelog consolidation automation now merges its PR immediately instead of leaving it for a human to review and merge. The in-run accuracy review remains the quality gate.

## 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added: `scripts/remove_old_flat_vault_secrets.py` — one-off cleanup tool that deletes the old flat per-service Vault entries for a tier (`secrets/minds/<tier>/<service>`) once they have been mirrored into the split layout. Refuses to delete any entry whose split mirror is missing or whose keys/values disagree; defaults to dry-run; requires `--yes` to actually delete.

### Changed

- Changed: `scripts/install.sh` now runs `mngr config wizard` as a final step to populate common user-scope configuration (e.g. whether to isolate the Claude config dir for local agents). Like the other steps, it prompts before changing anything and is safe to re-run.
- Changed: `scripts/push_vault_from_file.py` writes each declared key as its own single-`value` leaf at `secrets/minds/<tier>/<service>/<KEY>` (the new "split" Vault secret layout) instead of a single flat KV entry with many fields. `scripts/changelog_deploy.sh` reads `GH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the split layout.
- Changed: Removed the minds app's `postinstall` CSS-compile hook (it broke ToDesktop's `--prod` cloud install). The CSS build is now wired in explicitly at its real consumption points: a "Build Tailwind CSS for the e2e app" step in the CI minds_electron e2e job, and a `minds-css` dependency on the `just minds-test-electron` recipe.

## 2026-06-23

### Added

- Added: `just minds-start-cloud` recipe — launches the minds desktop client in dev mode to test the `imbue_cloud` provider against pre-baked pool slices. Unlike `just minds-start`, it leaves the form's shipped fallbacks in place (the canonical forever-claude-template remote plus `FALLBACK_BRANCH`) so an `imbue_cloud` create matches and fast-path leases a slice baked at that tag instead of dropping to the slow rebuild path. Also skips the live-mngr to `vendor/mngr/` rsync.
- Added: `just backfill-pool-host-keys` recipe wrapping `minds pool backfill-host-keys` for the activated minds env — the one-time SSH host-key backfill to run once per tier after deploying the host-key-pinning connector.
- Added: Optional `fct` positional argument on `just minds-start` to point a launch at a specific forever-claude-template worktree (absolute path used as-is; relative resolved against the mngr root). Omitting it keeps the previous default.
- Added: New runtime dependency `traceback-with-variables` (used by the minds Sentry integration to format tracebacks with local variables); updates `uv.lock`.
- Added: Design blueprints — `blueprint/discovery-health-watchdog/`, `blueprint/pin-imbue-cloud-host-keys/`, plus revisions to `blueprint/remote-mind-recovery/`.

### Changed

- Changed: Rewrote the `release-minds` skill to be a thin pointer to `apps/minds/docs/release.md`, the canonical release runbook, instead of describing its own (now-obsolete) release flow.
- Changed: Consolidated the docs describing how FCT's `vendor/mngr` is kept in sync into a single canonical place (`apps/minds/docs/vendor-mngr-sync.md`); the `minds-dev-workflow` and `minds-justfile` skills now point at it instead of re-describing the mechanisms.

## 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added: Design blueprints — `blueprint/consistent-provider-auth-failures/`, `blueprint/robust-minds-list-provider-errors/`, `blueprint/minds-flask-migration/`, `blueprint/remove-system-interface-asyncio/`, and `blueprint/unify-remote-host-lock/`.

### Changed

- Changed: Renamed `just minds-tailwind` to `just minds-css` — it now compiles the minds desktop client's Tailwind v4 stylesheet (`static/app.css` -> minified `static/app.min.css`) via the pinned `@tailwindcss/cli`, instead of fetching the Tailwind Play CDN JS bundle. The `.gitignore` entry tracks the new compiled artifact (`app.min.css`) in place of the retired `tailwind.js`.
- Changed: `forward-system-interface` justfile recipe now resolves an agent's id with `mngr list --on-error continue`, so an unauthenticated/unreachable provider no longer aborts the lookup of a local agent.

## 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added: Design blueprints `blueprint/sshd-restart-robustness/` and `blueprint/share-bare-metal-across-dev-envs/`.

## 2026-06-20

### Removed

- Removed: `bake-pool-host-{dev,prod}` justfile recipes (they baked OVH classic VPS pool hosts, now deprecated). Pool hosts are baked as bare-metal slices via the `bake-slice-{dev,prod}` recipes; `list-pool-hosts` and `destroy-pool-host` are unchanged and still cover legacy OVH VPS rows. The `minds-justfile` and `minds-dev-workflow` skill docs were updated to match.

## 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added: `specs/bare-providers/` (spec.md + concise.md + extraction_design.md) — design proposal for running agents directly on a cloud VM with no Docker container, introducing a substrate-x-realizer architecture and a staged rollout that later folds local/docker/lima/ssh into the same grid.
- Added: A set of provider specs under `specs/` (`provider-uniformity-review.md`, `provider-shape.md`, `implementing-a-provider.md`) covering all nine `mngr` provider plugins (modal, aws, azure, gcp, vultr, ovh, lima, docker, ssh), and `specs/provider-release-tests.md` condensed to a remaining-gaps tracker now that the shared `run_provider_release_trip{1..4}` harness has landed.
- Added: `blueprint/remote-mind-recovery/` design doc for extending minds' workspace-recovery flow to remote (Imbue Cloud) minds.
- Added: New `overlay` workspace library registered at the repo root (`[tool.uv.sources]` workspace source, plus `--cov=imbue.overlay` in the shared coverage flags).
- Added: New runtime dependency at the repo root (`uv.lock`): `google-cloud-storage>=2.18`, used by the GCP provider's offline `host_dir` GCS state bucket.

### Changed

- Changed: `make_cli_docs.py` now also generates the provider/agent config tables in each plugin README from the Pydantic field descriptions (the source of truth, also shown by `mngr config`), spliced between markers and verified by the docs `--check` gate so the tables can no longer drift from the code. The `regenerate-cli-docs` pre-commit hook now runs `make_cli_docs.py --check` (non-mutating, covering every generated file) and its trigger includes the provider/agent `config.py` / `plugin.py` sources.
- Changed: Updated the root pytest coverage config to track the renamed `imbue.mngr_vps` package (was `imbue.mngr_vps_docker`).

### Removed

- Removed: Monorepo-development-only paragraph (the `~/.local/bin` pre-commit shim note) from the top-level README so the published PyPI README stays focused on user-relevant content.

## 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added: New `identify-suspicious-edge-cases` skill — flags over-broad exception catches, fallback `else` branches, defensive guards, and unnecessary `| None` types under a given path.
- Added: `specs/provider-state-bucket/` design spec for the AWS / Azure offline state stored in cloud object storage (S3 / Azure Blob) so a stopped instance's host record, agent metadata, and `host_dir` are readable offline without hitting the 256-char EC2/VM tag-value limit.
- Added: `moto[s3]` to the root dev dependency group for in-memory S3 unit tests of the new AWS state bucket.

### Changed

- Changed: The `identify-*` skills (`identify-doc-code-disagreements`, `identify-inconsistencies`, `identify-outdated-docstrings`, `identify-style-issues`) now accept a `target_path` argument instead of a bare library name. You can scope them to a whole library or to any subdirectory within one; each skill resolves the scan scope and its containing library, and writes findings to the containing library's `_tasks/` folder.

## 2026-06-17

### Added

- Added: `scripts/make_agent_capabilities_doc.py`, a dev-only generator for a code-derived agent-capability matrix doc. It loads every installed mngr plugin (local backend only), builds the matrix from the agent classes plus their plugins, and either rewrites `libs/mngr/docs/concepts/agent_capabilities.md` or, with `--check`, fails if it is stale. Mirrors `scripts/make_cli_docs.py` and stays out of the shipped `mngr` wheel. Paired with a new `just regenerate-agent-capabilities-doc` recipe.
- Added: `just bake-slice-dev` and `just bake-slice-prod` recipes for baking bare-metal slices (lima/QEMU VMs on a pre-registered, prepped OVH bare-metal box) into the minds pool. Thin wrappers over `minds pool create --backend slice`, mirroring the existing `bake-pool-host-{dev,prod}` recipes for OVH VPSes.
- Added: Design specs — `specs/agent-plugin-parity/capability-mixins.md` proposing the code-derived agent capability taxonomy that shipped this run; `specs/gcp-azure-stop-start-lifecycle/spec.md` for bringing the AWS stop/start (idle-pause + resume) lifecycle to GCP and Azure; and `specs/common-transcript-standard/spec.md` tracking the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions in the agent-agnostic common-transcript schema (a `stop_reason` → `finish_reason` vocabulary alignment across all five emitters, plus a universal ordered `parts[]` field).

### Changed

- Changed: Updated `specs/agent-plugin-parity/spec.md` (new "Ordered assistant parts[]" row, transcript-capture note) and updated `specs/agent-plugin-parity/capability-mixins.md` to match what shipped (the three-state `Y`/`-`/`n/a` matrix with the code-derived `CapabilityScope` model, the positive `CliBackedAgentMixin` kind marker, the unified `live_output` capability, and the `session_resume` capability).
- Changed: The `just destroy-pool-host` recipe comment now documents that teardown mirrors the row's backend — cancelling the OVH VPS for an `ovh_vps` row, or destroying the lima VM (freeing the box slot) for a `slice` row — and that `--skip-vps-cancel` is for when the underlying machine is already gone.

## 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: Root-level wiring for the new `azure` provider plugin — `--cov=imbue.mngr_azure` in pytest coverage, `azure` registered in `scripts/make_cli_docs.py` `SECONDARY_COMMANDS` (so `mngr azure` gets a generated doc page alongside `aws` / `gcp`), and an `azure` create template in `.mngr/settings.toml` that builds the project Dockerfile on the VM (so azure agents get `gh` and the full mngr toolchain). `[providers.azure] builder = "DEPOT"` builds on depot's cached remote builders (requires `DEPOT_TOKEN` at create time).
- Added: Design specs — `specs/agent-usage-plugins/spec.md` (extending `mngr usage` to OpenCode, pi, and Codex), `specs/aws-ec2-stop-start-lifecycle/` (Modal-like idle-paused-but-resumable lifecycle for AWS agents via native EC2 stop/start; phases 1, 2, and 4 marked implemented), and `specs/cleanup-error-aggregation.md` (`mngr stop`/`destroy`/`cleanup` aggregate and classify failures with cause-specific exit codes).
- Added: Documented the install-wizard surfacing of the usage plugins in `specs/agent-usage-plugins/spec.md` and recorded the antigravity gap in `specs/agent-plugin-parity/spec.md` (new "Usage tracking plugin" row).

### Changed

- Changed: Synced the root design specs to the removed VPS-client snapshot surface and `list_ssh_keys` (`specs/vps-docker-provider/`, `specs/ovh-vps-provider/`, `specs/azure-provider/concise.md`, `specs/aws-ec2-stop-start-lifecycle/spec.md`).
- Changed: Extended the local-scratch `.gitignore` convention to Python and text files — `**/*.local.py` and `**/*.local.txt` are now ignored, mirroring the existing `**/*.local.md` and `**/*.local.sh` patterns. Lets one-off validation harnesses and probe scripts stay untracked and survive the stop hook's working-tree cleanup.
- Changed: `justfile`'s `sync-vendor-mngr` recipe realigned with the current release flow — its comment now tells you to position the mngr checkout at the **verified release SHA** (not blindly `main`, which can drift past it), points at `apps/minds/docs/release.md`, and no longer hardcodes a personal FCT path: the FCT checkout path comes from the positional arg, else `FCT_DIR` read from a gitignored minds-scoped `apps/minds/.env` (template: committed `apps/minds/.env.example`), else `$FCT_DIR` in your shell.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` now resolves and renders the ref name **and** the resolved commit instead of a tag-object SHA. The Slack notification and step summaries previously resolved `commit_sha` / `template_ref` with `git ls-remote refs/tags/<tag>` (no peel), so a run against an **annotated** tag (e.g. `minds-v0.3.1`) displayed the tag-*object* SHA — a SHA you can't `git checkout`. The `check_should_run` compute step now peels annotated tags (`^{}`), so no step surfaces a tag-object SHA anymore.

## 2026-06-15

### Added

- Added: `just minds-install` recipe that installs the minds desktop client's node deps (electron, etc.) using the Node version pinned in `apps/minds/.nvmrc` (selected via `select_node_version.sh`), so installs no longer fail with `ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE` when the shell's default node has drifted off the pin. `just minds-start`'s "not installed yet" hint points at it.
- Added: Design doc `blueprint/ovh-baremetal-slices/` for extending the imbue_cloud pool to allocate lima/QEMU VM "slices" on rented OVH bare-metal servers, and `blueprint/mngr-imbue-cloud-module-layers/` proposing the layered sub-package structure for `mngr_imbue_cloud` (with the `import-linter` ordering contract).
- Added: `import-linter` "mngr_imbue_cloud layers contract" (root `pyproject.toml`) plus a `test_meta_ratchets.py` test that enforces it.

### Changed

- Changed: Replaced `just bake-pool-host` with `just bake-pool-host-dev` (bake from a working tree — best-effort branch label) and `just bake-pool-host-prod` (clone an exact FCT tag — strict), reflecting that the imbue_cloud pool bake now derives the stamped repo identity from its source rather than from hand-typed `--attributes`. `just bake-pool-host-dev` also passes `--skip-deferred-install-wait` so dev pool bakes skip the few-minute deferred Playwright/apt install before stopping the services agent. The `minds-justfile` skill documents the dev-vs-production distinction.
- Changed: Expanded CLAUDE.md flaky-test guidance — first investigate why a test is flaky and try to make it more robust; if it is correct but fundamentally needs more time, bump that test's timeout (avoid unreasonably long timeouts — prefer leaving it marked flaky for infrastructure-level flukes).
- Changed: Bumped the per-test timeout on the `test_cli_docs_are_up_to_date` meta-ratchet — the enlarged imbue_cloud CLI surface (the new `admin server` + slice commands) made full CLI-doc regeneration exceed the default 10s pytest-timeout in the slower offload sandbox.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Per-PR changelog enforcement check, which had been passing vacuously in CI. The check previously ran as an acceptance test inside the offload Modal sandbox, but the sandbox's fresh `git init` made `main == HEAD` so the base-branch diff always came back empty — and any PR could merge without changelog entries. Enforcement now lives in a dedicated CI gate (`scripts/check_changelog_entries.py`, run via the `check-changelog` GitHub Actions job and `just check-changelog`) that computes the changed-file set against the real base branch on the orchestrator, and refuses to run with a non-zero exit if it cannot resolve a diff base distinct from HEAD.

## 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added: `scripts/extract_antigravity_proto_schema.py` -- a developer tool that recovers antigravity's (`agy`) protobuf schema by scanning the `agy` binary for embedded `FileDescriptorProto`s (agy ships no `.proto` files). Promoted from an inline appendix in `libs/mngr_antigravity/dev/README.md` so the new antigravity schema-verification release test can invoke it directly.
- Added: Implementation plan for the AWS minds compute provider under `blueprint/aws-minds-compute-provider/`.

### Changed

- Changed: The `dev` project's `CHANGELOG.md` is now date-organized (mirroring `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md`) instead of carrying an ever-growing `[Unreleased]` section; the nightly consolidation now summarizes each landed date independently into its own `## <date>` section, per `scripts/changelog_consolidation_prompt.md`.
- Changed: Updated `uv.lock` to add the `anthropic` package (and its transitive `docstring-parser` dependency), newly required by `libs/mngr_claude` for the shared typed Claude stream-json envelope.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `scripts/changelog_deploy.sh` now stops *every* Modal app in the changelog schedule's isolated environment before redeploying (via a new `--stop-all-apps` action in `scripts/changelog_schedule_utils.py`). A past app-naming-scheme change had orphaned an old cron app that kept firing a second nightly `mngr/changelog-consolidation-*` branch; sweeping the whole environment makes redeploys orphan-proof.
- Fixed: `modal app stop` invocations (in `scripts/modal_nuke.py` and the new changelog sweep) now pass `--yes`, so they no longer abort with "no interactive terminal detected" under newer Modal CLIs when run non-interactively.

## 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added: `aws` create-template in `.mngr/settings.toml` for dogfooding the codebase on AWS EC2 -- `mngr create -t aws <name>` builds the dev Dockerfile and runs an agent on EC2. The shared `[providers.aws]` config (`us-west-2`, `t3.large`, `auto_shutdown_minutes = 120`, `builder = "DEPOT"`) is committed; `DEPOT` requires exporting `DEPOT_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN`.
- Added: New design specs and blueprints under `specs/` and `blueprint/` (agent-plugin parity, env-settings overrides, discovery error-resilience, two-tier workspace recovery, host / imbue-cloud backups, R2 buckets, docker cleanup and gvisor hardening, the workspace color picker, the JinjaX template migration, the agent SDK, and more).
- Added: New Claude skills -- `minds-justfile` (routes minds tasks through the root justfile), `audit-ci` (audits recent CI runs for anomalies), and `identify-bad-tests` (flags low-quality / fragile tests into the library's `_tasks/`).
- Added: Changelog / release justfile recipes -- `just release` wraps `scripts/release.py`, `just changelog-deploy` (re)deploys the nightly consolidation schedule, and `just changelog-trigger` runs consolidation on demand. Plus pool-host recipes `just bake-pool-host` / `list-pool-hosts` / `destroy-pool-host` wrapping the env-aware `minds pool` CLI.
- Added: Nightly changelog consolidation now runs a per-project accuracy review, spawning reviewer subagents that verify the generated bullets against the actual code and commit corrections.
- Added: Supply-chain cooldown enforced at lock time -- root `pyproject.toml` `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` makes `uv lock` refuse any package newer than the cutoff, which `scripts/release.py` advances forward-only to `(today_utc - 2 weeks)` each release.
- Added: Pre-push hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` -- `uv-sync-pre-push` runs `uv sync --all-packages` when a push touches `uv.lock` / `pyproject.toml` (so later `uv run` hooks don't `ModuleNotFoundError` on a new workspace member), and a `ty` hook runs `uv run ty check` workspace-wide.
- Added: `scripts/make_cli_docs.py --check` mode reports stale generated CLI docs and exits non-zero; a new `test_cli_docs_are_up_to_date` meta-ratchet runs it so committed CLI docs / the PyPI README cannot drift from the generator.
- Added: Dev `mngr` shim (`scripts/mngr`) so `mngr` always runs the checkout you're working in (per-worktree, by cwd) instead of a stale global install; a pre-commit hook (`scripts/check_mngr_shim.sh`) installs and verifies it automatically.
- Added: New meta-ratchet `test_every_mngr_plugin_isolates_home_in_tests` -- every mngr plugin must call `register_plugin_test_fixtures(globals())` in a conftest so its tests redirect `$HOME` away from the developer's real home.
- Added: `scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`, a Modal-sandbox script that boots the desktop client and snapshots the running workspace; the resulting image ID can be passed to offload via `--override-image-id` to boot e2e runs from an already-warm workspace.
- Added: New CI workflows -- `release-tests.yml` (runs release tests on `workflow_dispatch` / `v*` tags, with `release.py` warning if it has not passed on the commit being tagged), self-hosted-macOS `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` (+ `minds-runner-reset.yml`), and a daily TMR cron plus a `TMR (reintegrate)` workflow sharing a `tmr-setup` composite action.
- Added: `just minds-test-electron` recipe (wraps the Electron acceptance test in `xvfb-run`; the `test-docker` job now installs Node / pnpm / xvfb) and `just test-sdk-live` (runs the `sdk_live`-marked live Claude Agent SDK tests).
- Added: Twice-daily `minds launch-to-first-message` schedule that builds and verifies current mngr `main` against FCT `main` with the full slack flow, surfacing drift before each workday.
- Added: Updated `.minds/template/cloudflare.sh` to document that `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` must now be an account-owned token with R2 storage permissions.
- Added: Design plan under `blueprint/host-backup-snapshot-rotation/` for fixing empty gVisor host backups -- unique time-named btrfs snapshots, keep-newest-N retention, and exit-code-only backup failure signaling.

### Changed

- Changed: Restructured the changelog consolidation prompt (`scripts/changelog_consolidation_prompt.md`) for more concise summaries -- concise `CHANGELOG.md` bullets are generated once per project (not once per date, which created cross-date duplicates), followed by a critical concision pass that drops non-notable bullets; the merge step also drops `Fixed` entries for bugs introduced and fixed within the release window.
- Changed: Nightly consolidation now treats each `CHANGELOG.md` as a notable-only summary -- non-notable (canonically, test-only) changes are omitted entirely (still kept verbatim in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md`), with a `dev`-project exception judged by developer / maintainer impact.
- Changed: Restructured the changelog system to one set of artifacts per project -- per-PR entries live at `<project_dir>/changelog/<branch>.md` and the consolidator routes each into the project's own `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md`; ratchets enforce the layout.
- Changed: Renamed the changelog tooling scripts to share a `changelog_` prefix (`changelog_consolidate.py`, `changelog_schedule_utils.py`, `changelog_deploy.sh`); `changelog_deploy.sh` now reads `GH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Vault at deploy time (`vault login -method=oidc` first).
- Changed: `scripts/release.py` now refuses to cut a release when any `changelog/` has unconsolidated entries, and points users at `just changelog-trigger` to run the consolidation on demand.
- Changed: Release tooling now auto-discovers the publish graph from the workspace (every `libs/*` package is a candidate unless listed in `UNPUBLISHED_PACKAGES`, enforced by a ratchet), walks every member's deps / extras / groups for internal-pin alignment (`test_internal_dep_pins_are_consistent`), and considers the full release-candidate cascade when offering new packages for first publication.
- Changed: `imbue-mngr-skills` is now published from its own GitHub repo as a plugin marketplace (mirroring `imbue-code-guardian`); this repo dogfoods the published plugin instead of carrying the skills in `.claude/skills/`.
- Changed: AWS provider root-level changes -- regenerated `mngr create` CLI docs (new AWS build-args help, dropped the Vultr / OVH `--vps-os=` line, per-provider prefix renames), added `aws` to `make_cli_docs.py` `SECONDARY_COMMANDS` and to top-level coverage, and added the six new AWS deps to `uv.lock`.
- Changed: Scripts (`release.py`, `modal_nuke.py`, `make_cli_docs.py`, `sync_common_ratchets.py`, `warm_cli_example.py`) no longer swallow unexpected failures -- PyPI lookups raise on network / HTTP errors, Modal identifiers come from documented `--json` keys (raising `ModalSchemaError` on schema drift), and several silent-fallback bugs now raise instead.
- Changed: `minds-launch-to-msg.yml` consolidated -- build moved to the self-hosted `minds-runner` Mac (so the `.app` ships Mac-native `uv` / `git` / `lima`), `commit_sha` made required (no stale-bundle escape hatch), the renamed `minds-macos-launch.yml` smoke folded in as a parallel job, and the shell-script + slack-mock pipeline rewritten as one Python script (`apps/minds/scripts/launch_to_msg_e2e.py`). Screenshots now ride only per-run GitHub artifacts (the ~1.2 GB `ci-screenshots` orphan branch was retired), with per-window Playwright captures as the headline shots.
- Changed: CI speedups -- acceptance wall-clock cut ~62% (`contents: write` for the image-cache git-notes push, `max_parallel` 200→50 for better LPT packing); `test-offload` / `test-offload-acceptance` unshallow only the current ref; and the dead `release`-branch jobs were removed (release tests moved to `release-tests.yml`).
- Changed: Consolidated `test_no_type_errors` / `test_no_ruff_errors` to run once repo-wide from `test_meta_ratchets.py`, removing ~36 redundant per-project copies.
- Changed: Retired the hand-written git-hook installer (`scripts/githooks/`) in favor of `uv run pre-commit install`, which installs every hook type (the old symlink installer only ever installed `pre-commit`).
- Changed: Dependency bumps under the two-week cooldown -- `ty` floor `0.0.24`→`0.0.39` (which no longer honors `# type: ignore[<code>]`; all were converted to `# ty: ignore[<rule>]`), majors via `uv lock --upgrade` (`paramiko` 3→4, `coolname` 3→5, `starlette` 0.50→1.0, `urwid` 3→4), the offload CI pin `0.9.5`→`0.9.7`, and Node-24 runtimes for `test-docker-electron` and all GitHub Actions.
- Changed: Tracked plugin renames / additions in root config -- `mngr_gemini`→`mngr_antigravity`, `mngr_uncapped_claude`→`mngr_robinhood`, and added `libs/mngr_mapreduce` to the workspace (+ coverage).
- Changed: Documented in `CLAUDE.md` -- release tests do not run in CI (must be run locally), per-PR changelog list bullets need a blank line between them, and how to tighten a ratchet count (`pytest --inline-snapshot=trim`). `CLAUDE.local.md` is now copied into agent workdirs so user-specific instructions are available inside agents.
- Changed: Skill fixes -- corrected stale dev-env naming in the `minds-dev-workflow` skill and `minds-start` hints (`dev-<user>`, tier prefix first), pointed `sync-tutorial-to-e2e-tests` at the new `e2e/tutorial/` dir, and removed the contradictory "commit when finished" notes from the `identify-*` skills.
- Changed: `just minds-start` selects the `.nvmrc`-pinned Node before launching (erroring with a hint if nvm / the version is missing, never auto-installing) and exports `MINDS_USE_LOCAL_WORKSPACE_DEFAULTS=1` so the create-form honors local-worktree defaults on any tier.
- Changed: `just forward-system-interface` writes the Cloudflare tunnel token to `runtime/secrets/cloudflare_tunnel.env`, matching the directory-based secrets layout; removed `.minds/template/paid-accounts.sh`, folding `MINDS_PAID_ADMIN_KEY` / `MINDS_PAID_LIST_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` into `supertokens.sh` (paid-user tracking moved to DB tables).
- Changed: `scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py` sets `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING=1` so the snapshot builder does not count toward Latchkey usage; genuine installs still count.
- Changed: TMR GitHub Actions workflow defaults `MNGR_USER_ID` to the shared `tmr-ci` namespace, reads inbound-SSH keys from a checked-in `.github/tmr-authorized-keys`, drops the removed `--use-snapshot` flag, and passes AWS secrets for the S3 report mirror.
- Changed: Collapsed Modal environments across `just test-offload-acceptance` / `test-offload-release` to a single shared env (opt-in via `MNGR_TEST_SHARED_MODAL_ENV_NAME`) to stay under the 1500-env-per-workspace cap; `sdk_live` tests are excluded from CI.
- Changed: Broadened the autofix auto-accept rules to cover any pure DRY cleanup that is a clear, no-behavior-change improvement.
- Changed: `scripts/install.sh` invokes `mngr dependencies --install interactive --scope core`, so a missing optional dependency (`ssh` / `rsync` / `unison` / `claude`) no longer trips the installer warning -- only missing core dependencies do.
- Changed: Updated the local-dev LiteLLM proxy config (`litellm_proxy/config.yaml`) to the full current Anthropic Claude lineup with per-token pricing, kept in sync with `apps/modal_litellm/app.py` by a drift test.
- Changed: `.gitignore` now ignores `**/*.local.sh` (mirroring `**/*.local.md`) and broadens the `_tasks/` rule to `**/_tasks/` so the root-level `dev/_tasks/` output folder is ignored too.

### Removed

- Removed: Broken `cleanup-pool-hosts` justfile recipe -- it sourced the long-gone `.minds/<env>/neon.sh` files (secrets moved to Vault) and was redundant with the connector's hourly release-cleanup cron; `destroy-pool-host` is the env / Vault-aware replacement.
- Removed: Unused `libs/flexmux/` project and all references (justfile recipes, ratchet exclusions, `uv.lock` workspace member).
- Removed: `test_no_dependencies_younger_than_two_weeks` from `test_meta_ratchets.py` -- the cooldown is now enforced at lock time via `[tool.uv] exclude-newer`, so the time-relative test is redundant.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Nightly changelog consolidation schedule fired at 8 AM Pacific instead of midnight -- the cron was set to `0 8 * * *` assuming UTC, but it is interpreted in the deploying machine's local timezone. Now uses `0 0 * * *` with an explicit `--timezone America/Los_Angeles`.
- Fixed: `just test-acceptance` marker expression was `-m "no release"` (a pytest syntax error that failed at collection); now `-m "not release"`.
- Fixed: TMR workflows now re-assert `mngr tmr`'s exit code via `exit "${PIPESTATUS[0]}"` after the `| tee` pipeline, so a failed run is no longer reported as successful when `pipefail` fails to propagate the left-side failure.
- Fixed: Added a `**/tmr-report/` pattern to the root `.gitignore` (the existing `**/tmr_*/` pattern used an underscore and did not match the dash-named directory).

### Security

- Security: Upgraded two vulnerable transitive dependencies in `uv.lock` to their fixed versions (surfaced by `uv audit`): `idna` 3.14→3.16 and `starlette` 1.0.0→1.0.1.

## 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added: `mngr_user_id` / `additional_authorized_hosts` `workflow_dispatch` inputs to the TMR GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed

- Changed: `CHANGELOG.md` is now version-organized — `[Unreleased]` accumulates categorized bullets across cron runs and `scripts/release.py` renames it on each release.
- Changed: Changelog consolidator groups entries by PR-landed committer date (America/Los_Angeles) and emits one `## YYYY-MM-DD` section per distinct date in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md`.
- Changed: Consolidation cron auto-merges `origin/main` before forking the per-run branch, so each PR's diff is just the consolidation commit.
- Changed: TMR GitHub Actions workflow uses the canonical `--format` flag (the previous `--output-format` was not a real option).

## 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: Per-PR changelog entry system in `changelog/` with nightly consolidation into `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` and a version-organized `CHANGELOG.md`; idempotent setup at `scripts/setup_changelog_agent.sh`.
- Added: New meta ratchet `test_every_project_excludes_tests_from_wheel` enforcing a uniform wheel-exclude pattern across every package.

### Changed

- Changed: Upgraded offload from 0.8.1 → 0.9.2 in CI with history-based test scheduling, thin-diff application fix, and propagation of `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` / `GITHUB_REF_NAME` to sandboxes.
- Changed: Workspace wheels uniformly exclude `*_test.py`, `test_*.py`, `**/conftest.py`, `**/testing.py` — previously `libs/mngr` was leaking three test helpers.
- Changed: `scripts/setup_changelog_agent.sh` redeploys when re-run (removes any existing schedule first) and drops the `CHANGELOG_REPLACE=1` gate; the consolidation cron's commit author is now `bot@imbue.com`.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Changelog consolidation cron commit author email corrected from `dev@imbue.com` to `bot@imbue.com` so GitHub attributes commits to the bot account whose token it uses.
