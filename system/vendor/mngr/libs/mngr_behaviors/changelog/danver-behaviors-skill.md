New plugin library: corpus-generic behavior tooling exposing the `mngr behaviors` command group.
A behavior corpus is a `<project>/behaviors/` directory of Gherkin `.feature` files in the language defined by the `behaviors` skill; each independent project owns its own corpus, so a codebase can leave the monorepo with its corpus, live-corpus guard test, and `witnesses` markers traveling together.
The corpus to operate on is named per invocation with the required `--root` (e.g. `uv run mngr behaviors validate --root <project>/behaviors` from the repo root).

- `validate` parses every `.feature` with `gherkin-official` and enforces the behavior language rules (English keywords only, kebab-case folders/basenames/tags, an identity tag on every unit, unique coordinate claims including Feature/Examples block tags, reserved `overview`/`invariants` filenames, no dangling `.md` sidecars or foreign files), printing every violation with file and line and exiting nonzero on any.

- `list` emits one JSONL record per authored unit (scenario, scenario-outline, or rule) carrying coordinate, kind, name, file, line, tags, steps, the parent Rule's coordinate for nested units, and `invariants` -- the coordinates of every Rule in scope for the unit (same-file Rules plus `invariants.feature` Rules at or above its folder).
  Selection filters AND-compose: `--unit` (kind), `--area` (folder subtree named as a dot-joined folder path), `--tag` (exact raw tag or coordinate), and `--name`/`--step` (case-insensitive substrings).
  Stdout is pure JSONL; problems that omit units from the listing go to stderr with a nonzero exit.

- `matrix` joins the corpus against the `witnesses(coordinate, partial=...)` markers in its paired test tree (harvested by an inner `pytest --collect-only` over the `--tests` roots, defaulting to the corpus root's parent -- the owning project), emitting one record per unit with its coverage (`full`, `partial`, or `none`) and witnessing tests.
  Coverage gaps are data (exit 0); broken links -- a marker naming no unit of this corpus, or invalid marker usage -- are errors reported per marker on stderr with a nonzero exit.

The scanning/validation/witness-harvesting engine is importable as `imbue.mngr_behaviors`, with `gherkin-official` (the Cucumber reference parser) as the arbiter of behavior syntax.
The plugin is registered in the mngr plugin catalog (INDEPENDENT tier, unpublished for now).
