## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: `mngr forward --use-http2` flag terminates TLS and negotiates HTTP/2 (via ALPN) for the workspace origin instead of plain HTTP/1.1, so the workspace UI is no longer capped by Chromium's ~6-connection-per-origin HTTP/1.1 limit. When set, the proxy generates a fresh self-signed cert at startup (SANs `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.0.0.1`; loaded via a transient 0600 temp file, never persisted), serves TLS + h2 via hypercorn (replacing uvicorn), and its client-facing URLs become `https`/`wss` with the `mngr_forward_session` cookie marked `Secure`. WebSockets (terminal, log stream, `/api/ws` state socket) keep working over the TLS connection. Off by default (a human running `mngr forward` still gets plain HTTP/1.1); there is no runtime HTTP fallback — if TLS setup fails the proxy exits during startup naming TLS/HTTP-2 as the cause.
- Added: `mngr forward` persists its per-agent service map to a small on-disk cache (`$MNGR_HOST_DIR/plugin/forward/service_map.json`) while running, and seeds the resolver from it at startup. A restored window onto a remote mind whose container is up becomes routable as soon as discovery supplies membership + SSH info, instead of waiting on the slow per-agent `mngr event ... services` stream (measured ~10s cold, ~50s under spawn contention). The live stream still runs and overwrites the seed as soon as it delivers, so a stale seed self-corrects within one stream connect. An empty, missing, or corrupt cache is a no-op.
- Added: `mngr forward --on-error {abort,continue}` flag (default `abort`). Under `continue`, the `--no-observe` startup snapshot tolerates an unauthenticated/unreachable provider (runs `mngr list --on-error continue` and forwards the agents the healthy providers reported instead of failing to start).

### Changed

- Changed: The forward stream manager now logs provider-level discovery errors once per process via the shared `DiscoveryErrorLogSuppressor` (with an info-level recovery line when discovery next succeeds), instead of one warning per poll cycle. Host- and agent-attributed discovery errors keep logging on every occurrence.
- Changed: `mngr forward` consumes mngr's new per-provider discovery model — the stream manager feeds every parsed discovery event into the shared span-aware `DiscoveryStateAggregator` and reacts to the returned membership delta (newly-present agents get a tunnel + `mngr event` stream, newly-absent agents are torn down). The plugin routes `ProviderDiscoverySnapshotEvent` (`DISCOVERY_PROVIDER`) plus incremental agent/host events; handling of the legacy global `FullDiscoverySnapshotEvent` (`DISCOVERY_FULL`) has been removed. Retain-on-provider-error semantics are unchanged, now provided by the aggregator's per-provider scoping.

### Fixed

- Fixed: "Loading workspace" proxy loader now re-attempts the workspace by polling in the background and reloading once it answers, instead of full-reloading itself every second via a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`. The old full reload stole OS focus from any other view layered over the loader (in the minds app, the bug-report modal), which made the modal's text field impossible to type into — the focus was cleared every second. Polling leaves the loader (and any overlay focused above it) untouched while waiting, and also keeps the spinner from visibly jumping on each tick.
- Fixed: Forward respawns a dead per-agent events stream instead of skipping it forever. After an agent's host restarted, the `mngr event --follow` child exited and `_start_events_stream`'s guard skipped the dead entry, so the service map stayed empty and the proxy returned 503 indefinitely even though discovery (including fresh SSH info) had fully recovered. The guard now treats a dead entry as absent: it drops the exited child, logs the respawn, and starts a fresh stream; respawns ride the periodic discovery snapshot, and already-known services are preserved across the respawn.
- Fixed: The websocket forward path now emits a `system_interface_backend_failure` envelope when the backend connection fails (unresolved target, SSH-tunnel setup failure, refused host-loopback dial, or a connect-time backend-websocket failure), matching the HTTP/SSE paths. Previously a consumer like minds could go blind to a dead system interface whose only live channel was a websocket — the user was stranded on a frozen workspace because the recovery redirect never fired.
- Fixed: `mngr forward --use-http2` no longer dumps "Unhandled exception in client_connected_cb / TimeoutError: SSL shutdown timed out" tracebacks for abandoned TLS connections. The serve loop bounds the wait for the peer's close_notify to a few seconds (instead of asyncio's full 30-second SSL shutdown timeout) and drops benign teardown errors of already-dead connections (SSL-shutdown `TimeoutError`, TLS handshake failures) instead of logging them as unhandled exceptions.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-06-18

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-06-16

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-06-16

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-06-15

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed: Reverse SSH tunnel teardown no longer leaves the forwarded port allocated on the remote sshd (which had caused the next run's port-forward request to be denied). `SSHTunnelManager.cleanup()` now attempts to cancel each reverse port forward unconditionally, instead of skipping the cancel when the connection looks inactive. Every tunnel SSH connection also sends periodic keepalives so an idle reverse tunnel does not silently die and the health check can repair a dead connection promptly.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added: Auto-discovered as a publishable package by the release tooling (it is a standalone `mngr forward` plugin, usable outside the minds bundle); will be offered for first publication to PyPI on the next release.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added: `mngr_forward` emits `system_interface_backend_failure` envelopes (renamed from `workspace_backend_failure`) on connection errors, mid-SSE EOF, or 5xx responses, so consumers like minds can drive a recovery UI; the plugin's 503 fallback page is now a styled card with a loading spinner.
- Added: `ReverseTunnelInfo.agent_id` field and matching `agent_id` parameter on `setup_reverse_tunnel`; new `remove_reverse_tunnels_for_agent(agent_id)` method that tears down every reverse tunnel tagged with a given agent (careful not to close an SSH client shared with live forward tunnels).
- Added: New `resolver_snapshot` envelope — the plugin emits the full per-agent service map on every mutation (both `update_services` and the destruction paths) so a consumer's mirror does not retain stale entries for destroyed agents. The full map is sent on every change (no per-agent diff) so a late-attaching consumer only needs the most recent envelope to be in sync.
- Added: `mngr forward --observe-via-file` makes the forward server consume discovery by tailing the shared discovery events file in-process instead of spawning its own `mngr observe --discovery-only` subprocess. Per-agent `mngr event` streams are still spawned for discovered agents. The flag is mutually exclusive with `--no-observe` and works with either `--service` or `--forward-port`. In this mode SIGHUP is a no-op (there is no observe child to bounce; the file's writer re-emits snapshots the tailer picks up automatically).

### Changed

- Changed: `SSHTunnelManager` (in `mngr_forward/ssh_tunnel.py`) is now the single SSH tunneling implementation in the monorepo — absorbed the latchkey package's parallel copy. The reverse-tunnel repair loop now uses per-tunnel exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, ..., capped at 5min) instead of a flat 30s cadence; failures clear on successful repair.
- Changed: `mngr forward` no longer crashes when its bind port is already in use — `--port` is now optional and falls back to an OS-assigned port if the default (8421) is taken; the server binds its listen socket up front and hands it to uvicorn so the `listening` envelope always reports the bound port.
- Changed: Renamed the workspace-server envelope contract to system-interface in lockstep with the mngr-side rename (`WorkspaceBackendFailure*` → `SystemInterfaceBackendFailure*`, envelope type `workspace_backend_failure` → `system_interface_backend_failure`); the 503 loader page now reads "System interface starting".
- Changed: Picks up the `FullDiscoverySnapshotEvent` schema bump (`providers`, `error_by_provider_name`); older builds raise `DiscoverySchemaChangedError` against new snapshots.
- Changed: `mngr forward` no longer drops a live agent when its provider's discovery merely errored on a poll — the stream manager retains agents whose provider is in the snapshot's `error_by_provider_name`, keeping their service mapping and per-agent event stream alive (logged at debug). A retained agent is only torn down on an explicit destroy or a later successful snapshot that omits it.
- Changed: Stopped following the per-agent `refresh` event source in `ForwardStreamManager`; default event sources are now just `services` and `requests`. The refresh-via-desktop-client mechanism has been superseded by an `open_tab` WebSocket broadcast from the workspace server.
- Changed: Unreachable backends (SSH-tunnel setup failure and refused host-loopback dial) are now treated as backend failures — the plugin emits a `CONNECT_ERROR` `system_interface_backend_failure` envelope and serves the styled "Loading workspace" loader to HTML callers. The "Loading workspace" loader no longer shows the explanatory "This page will reload automatically…" line.
- Changed: HTTP error handling simplified — the plugin no longer special-cases which status codes matter (previously tagged only 502/503/504 as `FIVEXX_RESPONSE` and 404-on-`GET` as `NOT_FOUND_RESPONSE`). It now forwards every response unchanged and emits a single `ERROR_RESPONSE` reason (carrying the `status_code`) for any non-2xx response, leaving the policy decision to the consumer.
- Changed: Added to the release tooling's publish graph (`scripts/utils.py`); will be offered for first publication to PyPI on the next release. Previously-unpinned internal deps (`imbue-mngr`, `imbue-common`, `concurrency-group`) are now pinned with `==` to their current workspace versions, as a published wheel requires. No runtime change.

### Fixed

- Fixed: "Workspace server starting" loader spinner animation duration now matches the page's 1-second auto-refresh interval so the spinner is at the cycle boundary when the reload fires.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: New `mngr_forward` plugin (`libs/mngr_forward/`) that serves `<agent-id>.localhost:8421/*` subdomain forwarding, signed login cookies, optional reverse SSH tunnels (`--reverse`), and CEL agent/event filters; SIGHUP bounces just the `mngr observe` child.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `mngr forward` subprocess no longer pegs ~130% CPU after agents disconnect — the bidirectional relay (lifted to `mngr_forward/relay.py`) now terminates when the paramiko channel has received EOF.
