"""Unit tests for the shared :class:`SSHTunnelManager`.

These tests cover the surfaces that can be driven deterministically: the
URL-parsing helper, the data shapes, the repair / setup loops against fakes, and
the reverse-tunnel bookkeeping.

The direct-tcpip refusal classification at the bottom of this file runs an sshd
of its own on loopback. What it settles cannot be settled against a fake by
construction -- see the comment there.

The manager is the single SSH tunneling implementation in the monorepo:
``mngr forward --service`` uses its forward (direct-tcpip) path, and both
``mngr forward --reverse`` and ``mngr latchkey forward`` use its reverse
path. The agent_id-tagged setup and the
:meth:`remove_reverse_tunnels_for_agent` cleanup hook are there so the
latchkey supervisor can tear down all tunnels belonging to a destroyed
agent in one shot.
