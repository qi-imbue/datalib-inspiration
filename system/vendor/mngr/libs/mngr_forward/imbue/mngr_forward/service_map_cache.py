"""Last-known per-agent service map, persisted across ``mngr forward`` runs.

The resolver's per-agent ``{service -> url}`` map is only populated after the
slow per-agent ``mngr event ... services --follow`` stream connects (measured
~10s cold, longer under spawn contention). Until then ``resolve()`` returns
``None`` and the proxy serves the 503 loading page.

This cache persists that derived map to disk while the plugin runs, so a fresh
run can seed the resolver from it at startup: a restored window then resolves
as soon as discovery supplies membership + SSH info instead of waiting on the
event stream. The live stream still runs and overwrites the seed as soon as it
delivers, so a stale seed self-corrects within one stream connect.

The cache is a single JSON object mapping agent id -> {service_name -> url}.
It lives under the caller-chosen path (the plugin points it at
``$MNGR_HOST_DIR/plugin/forward/``), so staging / production / local minds keep
independent caches automatically.
