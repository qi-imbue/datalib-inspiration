    * **Forward (direct-tcpip)**: for each unique (SSH host, remote endpoint)
      pair, a Unix domain socket in a secure temporary directory forwards
      connections through an SSH direct-tcpip channel. Used by the
      ``mngr forward`` plugin's per-service forwarding so subdomain requests
      hit the right backend inside the remote agent. Created on demand by
      :meth:`get_tunnel_socket_path`.
    * **Reverse**: ``Transport.request_port_forward("127.0.0.1", remote_port)``
      asks the remote sshd to listen on a port and tunnel connections back
      to a local TCP port. Used by the ``mngr forward`` plugin's
      ``--reverse <remote>:<local>`` flag and by ``mngr latchkey forward`` to
      reverse-tunnel the host-side Latchkey gateway into every discovered
      agent. Created by :meth:`setup_reverse_tunnel` and kept healthy by an
      optional background thread started via
      :meth:`start_reverse_tunnel_health_check`.

    Reverse tunnels are keyed by ``(conn_key, local_port)`` so a single SSH
    host can host multiple concurrent tunnels for different purposes -- e.g.
    one for ``--reverse 8420:8420`` and one per agent for the Latchkey
    gateway. Optional :attr:`ReverseTunnelInfo.agent_id` tags let the
    Latchkey destruction path tear down all tunnels belonging to a
    destroyed agent via :meth:`remove_reverse_tunnels_for_agent`.

    The repair loop uses a per-tunnel exponential backoff (capped at
    ``_REVERSE_TUNNEL_BACKOFF_CAP_SECONDS``) so a tunnel whose target is
    temporarily unreachable still recovers when the target comes back
    without hammering it on every 30s tick. Each successful repair fires
    the registered :meth:`add_on_tunnel_repaired_callback` callbacks so
    consumers (e.g. the plugin's ``ReverseTunnelHandler``) can emit a
    fresh envelope event with the possibly-new remote port.

    Forward-tunnel Unix sockets are created in a temporary directory with
    0o700 permissions (and 0o600 sockets), so the sockets are inaccessible
    to other users and same-user processes would need to discover the
    randomly generated directory path.

    retires just this one, which is how a transport failure gets the tunnel
    rebuilt on the next request. ``on_backend_refused`` is passed straight to

    """Per-forward port-forward handler that relays inbound channels to ``127.0.0.1:local_port``.

    Registered with paramiko via ``Transport.request_port_forward(..., handler=self)``.
    Paramiko invokes ``__call__`` on its own dispatch thread for every inbound
    connection to the specific reverse-forwarded port this handler is registered
    against. Using a per-forward handler is load-bearing: it is the only way
    paramiko preserves the ``(server_addr, server_port)`` routing info. The
    default queue-based ``Transport.accept()`` path discards that info, which
    silently cross-routes connections when multiple reverse tunnels share a
    single transport.

    Keeping ``__call__`` short is important: paramiko runs it on the transport's
    internal dispatch thread, so any slow work would back up the transport.
    We only do a non-blocking local ``connect()`` against loopback and hand
    off to a dedicated relay thread.
