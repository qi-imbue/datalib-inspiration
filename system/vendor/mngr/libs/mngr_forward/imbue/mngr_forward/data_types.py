class SystemInterfaceBackendFailureReason(UpperCaseStrEnum):
    """Why a per-agent backend forward attempt failed.

    Surfaced by the plugin so a downstream consumer can decide how to
    react (e.g. drive a health tracker / recovery UI).

    - ``CONNECT_ERROR``: the plugin could not establish a connection to
      the backend (httpx.ConnectError, or RemoteProtocolError / ReadError
      / a timeout before any response bytes, or a failure dialing the SSH
      host a remote backend lives on -- e.g. when the agent's host has
      gone away). It is the residual class: a failure that leaves the
      backend's own health unresolved, where it really may be at fault.
      ``TUNNEL_SETUP_FAILED``, ``POOL_EXHAUSTED`` and ``BACKEND_NOT_LISTENING``
      were split out of it precisely because they are *not* that. The plugin's own refusal to dial host loopback for
      an agent with no tunnel is reported here too -- the one case that
      dialed nothing and still leaves the backend unresolved.
    - ``TUNNEL_SETUP_FAILED``: this device could not build its own end of
      the tunnel -- no known_hosts file to pin the host key against, no
      private key to authenticate with, a local socket it could not
      create or bind. Evidence about the machine running the plugin,
      not about the agent's backend, which was never dialed. Only
      failures raised against this device's own filesystem and socket
      table carry this reason; anything that failed against the host,
      mid-handshake included, stays ``CONNECT_ERROR`` -- including a key
      that is present but no longer accepted, which cannot be told from
      the host rejecting us without asking it.
    - ``POOL_EXHAUSTED``: the plugin's own connection pool ran out (e.g.
      leaked streaming responses), so the backend was never dialed and
      its health is unknown. Again evidence about the plugin, not the
      backend.
    - ``BACKEND_NOT_LISTENING``: the SSH tunnel to the agent's host was
      established and the host refused the ``direct-tcpip`` channel to
      the inner port -- the host is reachable and nothing is serving the
      backend port. Distinguishes a dead service inside a live container
      from a container that cannot be reached at all.
    - ``SSE_EOF``: the backend answered -- its response headers arrived
      -- and the body then failed, either dropped or stalled until the
      read budget ran out. Despite the name (motivated by the SSE
      forwarding path that originally surfaced this), it also covers a
      buffered response, where no body bytes need have been delivered at
      all. What it always says is that the request reached the backend
      and the backend replied, which is what separates it from
      ``CONNECT_ERROR``.
    - ``ERROR_RESPONSE``: the backend answered with a non-2xx HTTP status.
      ``status_code`` carries the code. The plugin forwards the response
      unchanged and does not interpret which codes matter -- the consumer
      decides whether (and how) to react to a given status.
    - ``UNRESOLVED``: the backend resolver had no entry for the agent.
    - ``STALLED``: the plugin has waited on this request for its
      stall-notice window without a response. The window starts when the
      request is handed to the backend client, so it covers waiting for a
      pooled slot and the dial -- the backend need not have accepted the
      connection -- but not the routing and (for a remote agent) SSH tunnel
      setup that precede it, which can add a comparable delay. Unlike every
      other reason here the request has *not* failed -- it is still in
      flight and may yet succeed. It is emitted purely so a consumer can
      start probing a backend that may be wedged; a consumer must not treat
      it as evidence that the request itself failed.
