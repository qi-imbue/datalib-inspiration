"""FastAPI app for ``mngr forward``: auth + workspace-origin HTTP/WS forwarding.

Adapted from the subdomain-forwarding portions of minds' desktop client.
Application-specific routes (create form, accounts, sharing, request inbox,
telegram, chrome, etc.) stay in the host application; the plugin handles the
proxy surface:

- the bare-origin login flow (``/login``, ``/authenticate``, ``/`` debug index)
- the ``/_bridge`` browser-bridge handoff
- the ``/goto/<agent-id>/`` cookie-bridge to workspace-domain auth
- the ``/_subdomain_auth`` token-redemption handler on each workspace origin
- byte-level HTTP forwarding for ``[<service>.]agent-<hex>.localhost``
- WebSocket forwarding for ``[<service>.]agent-<hex>.localhost``
- the host-header middleware that routes the above

Every workspace owns a family of origins keyed by its agent id: the bare
``agent-<hex>.localhost`` origin serves the configured shell service, and
each registered service owns ``<name>.agent-<hex>.localhost`` (deeper labels
route to the same service -- they are the service's own sub-origin space).
One domain-scoped session cookie covers the whole family. Legacy
``host-<hex>`` origins still parse but are only ever redirected (or refused)
toward the canonical agent-keyed origin.

# How long a backend may go without answering before the plugin emits an
# advisory ``STALLED`` envelope. The request is deliberately *not* abandoned:
# the envelope only enrolls the agent for active probing, and the probe --
# not this timer -- decides whether the workspace is wedged. Cancelling here
# would additionally cap every proxied request at this value, which silently
# breaks any user app endpoint that legitimately takes longer.
_STALL_NOTICE_SECONDS: Final[float] = 30.0

# Backstop for a backend that goes silent. httpx applies this per read, not to
# the request as a whole, so it bounds the gap between bytes: a backend that
# answers headers and then keeps trickling never trips it, and is bounded only
# by its client staying connected. That is the first line of defence anyway --
# a request ends when its client disconnects, which is what keeps abandoned
# requests (minds' 2s health probe against a wedged backend) from accumulating
# against the proxy's connection pool (``_PROXY_POOL_LIMITS``). Nothing caps
# total request duration, by design: a cap there breaks any user app endpoint
# that legitimately runs long.
#
# The write side gets the same budget, and for the same reason: a backend that
# accepted the connection and then stopped reading the body is the mirror of one
# that stopped answering. A short budget there would be worse than on reads,
# because the body of a large upload is relayed byte-for-byte (over the SSH
# channel, for a remote agent), so a slow link legitimately spends minutes on it.
_PROXY_BACKSTOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: Final[float] = 600.0

# Establishing the connection and acquiring a pooled slot keep a short budget:
# unlike a slow response, neither is ever legitimately slow here (the dial is
# loopback or a local unix socket).
_PROXY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: Final[float] = 30.0

# SSE gets a tight read budget rather than the backstop. A silent stream is the
# chrome's fastest wedged-backend signal, and an SSE producer is expected to
# heartbeat, so a 30s gap here really is evidence of a problem rather than slow
# work. Its write side rides along on the same value, which costs nothing: an
# SSE request carries no body worth speaking of.
_SSE_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: Final[float] = 30.0

# How long a single write to the *client* leg of a streamed response may block.
# This is the mirror of the read budget above, on the other side of the proxy:
# the ASGI server enforces no write timeout of its own, so a client that goes
# quiet without disconnecting would otherwise block ``send`` forever. Kept as
# tight as the SSE read budget and for the same reason -- an SSE consumer that
# cannot accept a heartbeat within 30s is not reading the stream.

# Explicit pool ceilings for the two proxying paths. Both exist because httpx's
# default (100 connections) exactly matches hypercorn's h2_max_concurrent_streams,
# so 100 wedged streaming responses used to dead-end every proxied request with a
# pool timeout that never dialed the backend. What both values buy is distance
# from that coincidence: a ceiling well clear of the h2 stream limit means one
# wedged client connection can no longer saturate the pool, and a leak that gets
# past the guards below degrades gradually instead of hard-failing all traffic at
# once. Neither is tuned against a measured resource budget -- this process never
# sets its own RLIMIT_NOFILE, and what it inherits depends on whoever spawned it
# -- so both are set far above any healthy concurrency rather than at a

    ``allow_host_loopback`` opts the proxy in to dialing host loopback when an
    agent's registered URL is loopback and no SSH tunnel exists. The default
    of ``False`` is the safe one: any non-DEV agent whose SSH info hasn't
    been published gets a 502 instead of silently serving whatever else is
    bound on the host's loopback at the registered port. Pass ``True`` only
    for setups that intentionally run agents directly on the host (the
    legacy ``LaunchMode.DEV`` flow).

    ``stall_notice_seconds`` is how long a backend may go without answering a
    buffered request before an advisory ``STALLED`` envelope is emitted (the
    SSE path arms no such timer -- it still fails outright at its own read
    budget). It never abandons the request: what ends one is its client
    disconnecting, behind which ``_PROXY_BACKSTOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` bounds only
    how long the backend may stay silent, not the request as a whole.

    ``use_http2`` reflects whether the server terminates TLS (and negotiates
    HTTP/2); when set, the client-facing URLs this app constructs use
    ``https``/``wss`` and its session cookie is marked ``Secure``. It does not
    itself enable TLS -- the serve path does -- but the two must agree so the
    URLs the browser is told to visit match the scheme the socket speaks.

    ``browser_bridge_token`` enables the ``/_bridge`` route (see
    ``_handle_browser_bridge``); ``embedder_origins`` extends the
    ``frame-ancestors`` policy appended to every proxied workspace response
