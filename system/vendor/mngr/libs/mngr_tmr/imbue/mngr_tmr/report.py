"""HTML report generation for the test-mapreduce plugin.

The reporter takes a list of ``AgentMetadata`` from orchestration and
reads each agent's outcome JSON from ``output_dir/<agent_name>/`` on
demand. Outcome JSON shape is a contract between the agents and this
module; orchestration does not parse it. Parsed outcomes are cached
in-process (test-agent outcomes and the integrator outcome are
immutable once an agent has published them, so caching is safe).

The HTML template, the CSS, and the panel JS live under ``report_assets/``
and are rendered with Jinja2. This module's job is to assemble the
context dict the template renders against.

The test-mapreduce-specific data types (``TestResult``, ``Change``, etc.)
also live here -- they're only used by this module. Framework-side types
live in ``imbue.mngr_mapreduce.data_types``.
