"""Shared sentry-sdk initialization for our Modal apps (reporting to self-hosted Bugsink).

Every reporting service (remote_service_connector, modal_litellm,
oauth_redirector) calls :func:`init_sentry` at the top of its Modal
functions. The DSN points at the tier's self-hosted Bugsink instance and
arrives via the per-deploy ``sentry-<tier>-<deploy_id>`` Modal Secret; a
missing/empty DSN (a tier whose ``sentry`` Vault entry is not yet
provisioned) or ``MINDS_SENTRY_DISABLED=1`` makes the whole thing a no-op,
so consumers never depend on Bugsink being up.

Unlike the rest of this package, this module imports ``sentry_sdk`` -- so
any app that imports it MUST pin ``sentry-sdk`` in its image dependency
group (see the per-module allowance in ``test_project_ratchets.py``).

The event rate limiter below is a deliberately slim, stdlib-only
reimplementation of ``imbue.imbue_common.sentry.core._SentryEventRateLimiter``
(which cannot be used here: the containers ship only the app package plus
this one, and the original is coupled to loguru/pydantic). It is the
crash-storm control: a tight error loop is the same exception repeating,
and per-key dedup collapses it client-side before it hits the wire.
