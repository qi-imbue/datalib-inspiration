## 2026-07-16

Added attach, peek, and reply to the kanpan board, so you can work with an agent without leaving it:

- Attach to the focused agent's session with `Enter`. The board suspends while attached and restores immediately when you detach (`Ctrl-b d`), returning you to the board instead of a bare shell. On attach the screen clears to a brief `Connecting to <agent>...` line rather than flashing the shell behind the board; a failed connect shows its exit code as a footer message instead of vanishing with the repaint.

- Peek at an agent with `Space`: a live bordered panel below the board shows the agent's recent user/assistant conversation (via `mngr transcript --role user --role assistant`), refreshed every couple of seconds, with the board still visible above. Tool calls and framework-injected turns do not appear, so the peek reads like the human conversation. Each `[timestamp] role:` header is trimmed to a dim role cue. It shows the newest lines, so a long final message renders its end under a `⋯` marker rather than being cut off at the top or mirroring the agent's scrolled-up screen. The panel says `(no messages yet)` when there is no readable message, and its border title (`name · state · provider`) re-renders on every board refresh so it cannot go stale. `Esc` closes the panel.

- Reply from the peek panel: type into the `›` input and press `Enter` to send a message to that agent (an empty reply does nothing). Your reply is echoed into the panel immediately as a `›` line, so it appears without waiting; the send runs in the background (`mngr message` blocks up to ~90s on the agent's submission signal, which a busy agent cannot give until its current turn ends), and once the agent accepts the reply and it shows up in the transcript the echo is replaced by the real message. Several replies typed in a row are delivered in order. A failed send drops its echo and renders a dim `(reply failed: ...)` line, so a lost message never silently looks delivered.

- The reply input supports readline-style editing (via the `urwid_readline` library, with the Option/Ctrl+arrow chords added): word movement (`Option`/`Ctrl`+`←`/`→`, `Meta-B`/`F`), word delete (`Option`+`Delete`, `Ctrl-W`, `Meta-D`), jump to start/end (`Ctrl-A`/`Ctrl-E`), and kill to start/end (`Ctrl-U`/`Ctrl-K`).

- The footer is a single continuous blue belt (no gap between its two sides): on the left a relative refresh stamp -- `Refreshed just now · 3.2s` right after a refresh, aging to `Refreshed 32s ago` / `Refreshed 5m ago` (the fetch duration only shows while fresh) -- and on the right the command keys one forgets -- `r: refresh  m: mute  d: mark delete  x: execute  q: quit  ?: more keys` -- with the keys highlighted. Everything else (`space` peek, `enter` attach, marks, configured shell commands) is listed by the `?` overlay: a bordered, padded panel anchored above the footer's `?`, keys accented in their own column; `Esc`, `q`, or `?` closes it. The peek panel's `enter: send · esc: close` hint is quiet in-panel text, tucked into the bottom right, with the same key accent.

- Fixed: the row focus highlight is now one continuous band across muted and stale cells; inverting their dim gray used to punch dark holes in it.

- Kanpan sets the terminal title (`kanpan`) while running: it re-takes the title after you detach from an attached agent session (which sets its own), and restores the previous title on exit in terminals that support the title stack.

## 2026-07-01

Added a new async/await ratchet (`test_prevent_async_await`) that freezes the current amount of `async def` / `await` usage in this project and fails if new async code is added. We strongly prefer synchronous code: it is far easier to debug, and our software is intentionally low-scale, so async provides no benefit. Existing usage is grandfathered in at its current count; the count can only decrease.

## 2026-06-19

The kanpan plugin's cross-scope config merge now follows the same standard config-merge semantics as every other config field. Previously `KanpanPluginConfig` carried a custom `merge_with` that automatically *unioned* its six dict fields (`commands`, `data_sources`, `shell_commands`, `columns`, `on_before_refresh`, `on_after_refresh`) across config scopes (user < project < local), so a key set by a lower scope always survived. That method is removed and the merge now runs through the standard overlay pipeline: these fields assign-by-default, guarded by the cross-scope narrowing detector.

The user-visible effect: when a higher-precedence scope's `[plugins.kanpan]` block drops a key that a lower scope set in any of those six dict fields, it now raises the standard flag-gated settings-narrowing error (naming the scopes and how to opt in) instead of silently unioning the two scopes. To merge additively, use the `__extend` operator; to assign and drop keys without the warning, set `allow_settings_key_assignment_narrowing = true` (or use `key__assign`). Pure additions -- a higher scope that keeps every lower-scope key and adds more -- still apply unchanged.

Trimmed the README to user-relevant content and tightened it for concision.

## 2026-06-15

`mngr kanpan --help` synopsis: replace placeholder `[OPTIONS]` with an enumerated list of the filter flags users typically reach for -- `[--include CEL] [--exclude CEL] [--running] [--stopped] [--archived] [--active] [--local] [--remote] [--project PROJECT]`. The full agent-filter set is still available; rarely-used flags (`--label`, `--host-label`) are omitted from the synopsis but remain on the command.

## 2026-06-14

Fixed the kanpan footer flickering when a background refresh and a user action (e.g. deleting a marked agent) ran at the same time. The footer is now driven by a single writer that picks what to show by priority (transient notification > active action > refresh spinner > marked-agent summary > steady text), so overlapping spinner loops can no longer overwrite each other on alternating ticks.

Batch operations in the kanpan TUI (delete, push, and markable custom commands) now surface failures instead of silently doing nothing. When `x` execution fails, the per-agent error detail (including a clear "timed out after Ns" message for timeouts) is listed at the bottom of the board, in the same place fetch errors appear, and persists until the next execution. The marks for failed agents are kept so you can retry.

## 2026-06-10

`mngr kanpan --format json` now prints a single board snapshot instead of launching the TUI, for programmatic use. The JSON has the ordered columns, agents grouped into sections (with human labels), and any fetch errors; each agent carries both the pre-rendered cells (text/url/color) and the structured field values (PR number, CI status, commits-ahead count, etc.).

`--format jsonl` is also supported: it emits one agent record per line in board order, followed by any error lines.

Previously `--format json` was accepted but silently ignored.

The GitHub data source now pages through PR search results instead of fetching only the first 100. Boards tracking more than 100 agents previously hit GitHub's hard per-page cap and silently rendered "Create PR" for the overflow agents; kanpan now follows the search cursor and fetches every page (up to GitHub's ~1000-result ceiling, beyond which it surfaces an explicit error).

Each page request is also retried with exponential backoff when GitHub returns a transient failure (HTTP 403 secondary rate limit, 5xx, or an unparseable body). A failure on a later page keeps the pages already fetched and retries only the failing page, so earlier results are never re-fetched.

Raised the stale coverage floor from 83% to 85% to match the coverage CI already measures (~86%).

## 2026-06-04

Adopted the new repo-wide `per-file host uploads inside loops` ratchet check (flags write_file/write_text_file/put_file calls inside loops, which should use a single rsync via host.copy_directory instead). No production code change in this project.

## 2026-06-01

Fixed a bug where muted agents could appear mixed in with the other rows
(typically alongside "PRs not loaded") whenever provider discovery transiently
failed during a refresh -- e.g. a flaky network connection to a remote
provider. Previously the board loaded the muted set with a separate
all-or-nothing discovery pass, so if any one provider failed to load, the
entire muted set came back empty and every agent was reclassified by its PR
state.

The muted flag is now surfaced as a regular agent field via kanpan's
`agent_field_generators` (online) and `offline_agent_field_generators`
(offline) hooks, so it rides on the same agent list the board already fetches
through `list_agents` -- which tolerates a failing provider. A provider failing
during a refresh no longer drops the muted classification of agents on the
providers that did load, and the muted bit is preserved for offline/unreachable
agents too.

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

No user-facing behavior change.

# ty 0.0.39 type fixes

- Converted bracketed `# type: ignore[...]` suppressions to `# ty: ignore[...]` (test file), as required by `ty` 0.0.39.
- `_submit_batch_item` now dispatches on the command type with a `match` statement (`case MarkableBuiltinCommand()/ActionBuiltinCommand()/CustomCommand()`, with a `case _: assert_never(item.cmd)` catch-all) instead of an `isinstance` chain. This narrows `item.cmd` to `CustomCommand` before reading `.command` (which ty could not prove via the previous structure) and makes exhaustiveness explicit. Behavior is unchanged.
- Documented the urwid `Widget` -> `Text` downcast on a row's name cell with a `# ty: ignore[invalid-assignment]` (the first column is always a `Text` by construction, but urwid types `.contents` only as `Widget`).

- Tightened this project's `test_ratchets.py` violation counts to their exact current values (`--inline-snapshot=trim`).

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Adopted the `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (added in `imbue_common`) via
`rc.check_bare_tmux_targets(_DIR, snapshot(0))` in this project's `test_ratchets.py`.
This ratchet prevents new occurrences of `tmux <subcmd> -t '<bare-name>'` -- targets
without a leading `=` exact-match prefix, which can silently route commands to a
sibling session whose name shares a prefix with the intended one. No production code
changes in this project; the adopting test starts at a baseline of zero violations.

## 2026-05-26

Collapse the GitHub data source's four separate `gh` calls (`gh pr list --state open`, `gh pr list --state all`, `gh pr view --json mergeable`, `gh api graphql` for unresolved threads) into a single `gh api graphql` request per board refresh. The new query uses GitHub search's OR semantics over `repo:` and `head:` qualifiers to filter directly to the (repo, branch) pairs the agents need, and embeds `mergeable`, `statusCheckRollup { state }`, `reviewThreads`, and `comments` inline on every returned PullRequest. This eliminates the gh HTTP cache race that the lock-based fix was working around (no `gh pr list`, no SearchType introspection, no cache file to corrupt), provides an atomic point-in-time snapshot of the entire board, and cuts the refresh from 2M+2K HTTP calls (where M = unique repos, K = open PRs) to exactly one. Removes ~250 lines of fetch/parse/orchestration code along with the `_GH_PR_LIST_LOCK`, the `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and the conflicts/unresolved second-pass fetcher.

## 2026-05-21

Fix the intro in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` so it references the correct entries directory. The path was `changelog/<project>/` (which never existed); the actual layout is `<project_dir>/changelog/`.

## 2026-05-20

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

## 2026-05-08

## mngr_kanpan: staleness taint semantics

Field values now track when they were computed and render dimmed when older than a configurable threshold, surfacing potentially-out-of-date data at a glance.

- Added a required `created: datetime` field to every `FieldValue`. Values derived from cached inputs inherit the oldest `created` of the inputs they actually used (taint propagation); world-derived values use the current time.
- Added `staleness_threshold_seconds` to `KanpanPluginConfig`. Defaults to 90% of `refresh_interval_seconds` so values that weren't refreshed last cycle render as stale.
- Stale cells render in dark grey via new `stale` / `stale_focus` urwid palette entries. Muted-row dimming wins over per-cell stale dimming.
- `ShellCommandConfig` now declares its cached `inputs` explicitly so shell-derived staleness can propagate correctly. Shells with no declared inputs are treated as world-fresh.
