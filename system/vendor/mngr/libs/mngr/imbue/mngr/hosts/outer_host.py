"""Concrete OuterHost: a minimal pyinfra-backed host with no agent / lifecycle /
snapshot / tag machinery.

Used to access the underlying machine (VPS, local box, SSH-reachable docker
daemon host) that hosts a container/sandbox managed by mngr. Has no host_dir,
no certified data, no agents, no idle tracking. Just file ops, command
execution, and SSH info.

A regular Host (which implements OnlineHostInterface, which extends
OuterHostInterface) is also an OuterHostInterface, so providers whose outer
is itself an mngr-managed Host can return that Host directly. OuterHost is for
the cases where the outer is *not* an mngr-managed host (e.g. the VPS hosting
a container, or the SSH-reachable docker daemon machine).
