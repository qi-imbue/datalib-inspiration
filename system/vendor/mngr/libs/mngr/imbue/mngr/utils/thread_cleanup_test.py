"""Unit tests for thread-local gevent Hub cleanup.

The regression here guards against the leak in gevent issue 1601: destroying a
per-thread hub without joining it first parks the hub greenlet mid-``LoopExit``,
whose traceback pins the worker's frames in a cycle the GC cannot break, so a
fresh Hub (and everything the task referenced) is stranded on every call.
