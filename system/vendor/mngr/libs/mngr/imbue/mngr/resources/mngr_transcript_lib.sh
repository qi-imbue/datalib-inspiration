# mngr_transcript_lib.sh -- Shared primitives for raw-transcript streamers.
#
# Sourced by per-agent stream_transcript.sh scripts (claude, ...) to
# share the parts of raw-transcript capture that are structurally identical
# regardless of the agent's native session schema:
#
#   - mngr_transcript_build_id_set OUTPUT_FILE FIELD
#       Populate the associative array _MNGR_TRANSCRIPT_ID_SET with every value
#       of FIELD found in OUTPUT_FILE. Used at startup and when a late-
#       appearing session file needs reconciliation. Correlation fields (uuid,
#       id) are matched with a bash regex, so no jq is required.
#
#   - mngr_transcript_reconcile_offset SESSION_FILE FIELD
#       Echo the highest 1-indexed line of SESSION_FILE whose FIELD value is
#       already present in _MNGR_TRANSCRIPT_ID_SET, or 0 if there is none. Used
#       to recover after a crash that may have dropped the stored offset. Scans
#       forward, so it needs no `tac` (GNU coreutils, absent on macOS).
#
#   - mngr_transcript_emit_lines_range SESSION_FILE START END OUTPUT_FILE
#       Append lines START..END (inclusive, 1-indexed) of SESSION_FILE to
#       OUTPUT_FILE using sed with a bounded range. The caller computes
#       end via wc -l before reading, so any lines appended to SESSION_FILE
#       between wc and sed are deferred to the next poll cycle (TOCTOU-safe).
#
#   - mngr_transcript_percent_encode_path PATH
#       Echo PATH with characters not safe in a single filename ('/', '%')
#       percent-encoded. Used by streamers whose offset keys are file paths;
#       streamers whose keys are uuid-shaped (claude) can skip it.
#
# All functions are pure / read-only except for population of
# _MNGR_TRANSCRIPT_ID_SET. Callers are responsible for declaring that array
# (so it survives function-local scope) and for clearing it when no longer
# needed.

# The ERE matching a top-level "<FIELD>": "<value>" pair, capturing the value.
# Matched inline in the loops below: a command substitution would fork a subshell
# per line, and a session file runs to tens of thousands of lines.
#
# Limitations: matches the *first* such pair in the line. Agent-emitted JSONL
# events keep correlation fields (uuid, id) at the top, so the first match is the
# right one. FIELD is interpolated into this ERE literally (as printf's %s), so
# callers must pass a regex-safe field name; the uuid/id callers do.
