# sigwinch_panes.sh -- keep an agent's tmux pane usable and repainted after a client attaches.
#
# Runs from a per-session tmux `client-attached` hook (via `run-shell -b`) in one of two modes:
#
#   fit   -- the default sizing policy. The agent window is pinned to window-size=manual (so a
#            degenerate client on the shared tmux server can never collapse it), and this script
#            re-fits the window to the attaching client's geometry, floored at a usable minimum
#            (_MIN_WIDTH x _MIN_HEIGHT) so a degenerate (e.g. 2x1) client cannot shrink the pane
#            below what Claude Code's Ink TUI needs. It then signals the panes to repaint.
#            Usage: sigwinch_panes.sh <session> <primary_window> fit <client_width> <client_height>
#
#   nudge -- an explicit window_size policy is in effect; tmux owns resizing. This script only
#            repaints, and skips a truly-pinned (window-size=manual) window (nothing to repaint).
#            Usage: sigwinch_panes.sh <session> <primary_window> nudge
#
# Repaint = send SIGWINCH to every pane's child processes (via pgrep -P) across all windows so the
# in-pane process (e.g. claude) re-queries TIOCGWINSZ and redraws. We signal the pane PID *and its
# children* rather than relying on tmux's automatic SIGWINCH: the agent is typically a child of the
# pane shell and may not be the pane's foreground process-group leader, so tmux's signal does not
# reach it reliably.
#
# `run-shell -b` backgrounds this relative to the attach, so the attach is never blocked while we
# wait out the delay below (it lets the window settle at the new client first). Invoked directly
# (e.g. in tests) it runs synchronously; set the delay to 0 there.
