"""Shared harness for agent-plugin release (end-to-end) tests.

Every agent-type plugin ships a ``@pytest.mark.release`` test that drives the real
``mngr`` CLI against the real agent binary through the same lifecycle arc:

    create -> WAITING -> message -> turn runs -> transcript captured
           -> stop -> start -> recall a pre-restart secret -> destroy
           -> adopt the preserved session into a fresh agent -> recall again

The arc and its assertions are identical across agents; only the *plumbing* differs
(how the binary is launched and authenticated, how the workspace is seeded, which
flags ``create`` needs, how tmux is isolated). This module owns the arc and the
shared assertions; each plugin supplies an :class:`AgentReleaseProfile` that owns its
plumbing. A single ``run_agent_release_lifecycle(profile, tmp_path)`` call is then the
whole release test, so the parity the spec describes is enforced executably: every
agent is held to the same lifecycle and the same canonical-transcript contract.

The shared assertions are keyed on the **common transcript** (which every agent emits,
and which `imbue.mngr.agents.common_transcript_records` makes canonical). Every agent is
held to the same core arc -- it surfaces the RUNNING marker and resumes on stop/start and
adoption. Two capabilities still vary by agent: forcing a bash tool call (so the transcript
carries a tool_call nested on the assistant turn plus its tool_result) is gated by
``forces_tool_call`` because antigravity cannot satisfy it (it runs the command async and
ends the turn before the result settles, so a single forced-tool turn carries no
tool_result -- see its profile), and reporting per-message token usage is gated by
``asserts_usage`` since not every CLI exposes it.

These tests are not run in CI (release-marked); run a profile's test manually with the
real binary present, e.g.::

    uv run pytest -m release -p no:xdist --no-cov \\
        libs/mngr_opencode/imbue/mngr_opencode/test_opencode_agent.py
