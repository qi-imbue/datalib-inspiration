"""Canonical schema for the agent-agnostic common-transcript stream.

Every agent plugin emits a common, agent-type-independent JSONL stream (claude,
codex, antigravity, opencode, pi-coding). Each line is one record whose ``type``
is ``header``, ``step``, or ``observation``: a streaming form of ATIF (Harbor's
Agent Trajectory Interchange Format; see ``specs/atif-transcript-alignment/spec.md``
and the vendored models under :mod:`imbue.mngr.agents.data_types.atif`). Streams
written before the ATIF cutover (see :data:`LEGACY_RECORD_TYPE_NAMES`) are reported
as unsupported rather than rendered or rebuilt.

Each record carries three *framing fields* that belong to mngr's stream container,
not to ATIF: ``type`` (the record discriminator), ``event_id`` (the source-derived
idempotency key emitters dedup on), and ``emitter`` (the emitting source, e.g.
``claude/common_transcript``). All remaining fields are ATIF fields, composed from
the vendored sub-models so the payload shapes are stated exactly once. The
doc-builder strips the framing fields when assembling a full ATIF document.

This module is the single source of truth for that contract. The contract is
enforced at *emit* time, not read time: each plugin's conformance test asserts its
emitter's real output validates against this schema, so the five independently
written emitters (opencode and pi-coding in TypeScript; claude, antigravity, and
codex in shell+Python) cannot silently drift on the shared fields. The reader
(:mod:`imbue.mngr.cli.transcript`) deliberately stays tolerant -- it renders
whatever an agent emitted rather than validating against this schema.

The records are strict (``extra="forbid"``): per-agent annotations belong under
the ATIF ``extra`` objects, so the doc-builder can treat every other field as an
ATIF field.
