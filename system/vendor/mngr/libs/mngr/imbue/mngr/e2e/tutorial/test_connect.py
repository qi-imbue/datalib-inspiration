"""Tests for the connect-to-agent commands from the tutorial.

The tests are intentionally kept as separate functions (not parametrized) so that
each one has a 1:1 correspondence with a tutorial script block.

``mngr connect`` execs ``tmux attach`` for a local agent, so it requires a real
terminal and blocks until the client detaches. Unlike ``create``/``start`` (whose
``connect_command`` the fixture rewrites to a no-op recorder), the standalone
``connect`` command does the real attach and cannot run under the plain
pipe-based ``e2e.run`` -- it would abort with "open terminal failed: not a
terminal". The happy-path tests therefore use ``e2e.run_connect_interactively``,
which wires the command to a PTY, waits for the client to attach, and detaches it
from outside so the command exits cleanly. The unhappy-path tests (bad id/host)
fail before reaching the attach, so they use the plain ``e2e.run``.
