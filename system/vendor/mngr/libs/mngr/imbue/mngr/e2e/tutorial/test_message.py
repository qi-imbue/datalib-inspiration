"""Tests for ``mngr message`` variants from the tutorial.

Each test carries its tutorial script block verbatim in its docstring under a
``Tutorial block:`` section. Where the block addresses fictional agent names
(agent-1, agent-2, ...), the test creates real agents with those names first so
the message command has somewhere to land.
