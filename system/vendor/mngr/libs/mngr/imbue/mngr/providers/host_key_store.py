"""Structured store of SSH host-key pins, from which known_hosts files are rendered.

The store is the source of truth for which host keys are trusted at which
endpoints; the known_hosts file next to it becomes a derived artifact. Each
known_hosts file gets a JSON sidecar (``<name>.pins.json``) holding one
:class:`HostKeyRecord` per host (plus one shared record for pins that were
imported from pre-store file content and cannot be attributed to a host).

Precedence rules, applied per ``(address, port, keytype)`` endpoint:

- a USER-origin pin (material originating from the user's own devices, e.g. a
  rotation or adoption) is replaced only by newer USER-origin material;
- a BOOTSTRAP-origin pin (material vouched for by an external party, e.g. a
  connector at lease handoff, or a locally-generated provider key) is
  replaceable by anything.

Every mutating operation first imports any lines that were written to the
known_hosts file behind the store's back (as BOOTSTRAP pins), so nothing that
an unmigrated writer appended is ever lost when the file is re-rendered.
