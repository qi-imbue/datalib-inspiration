"""Preserve files from an agent's state directory to local storage on destroy.

When an agent (or its whole host) is destroyed, the agent's state directory is
deleted. Some files in it are worth keeping -- session transcripts, logs, etc.
This module provides a single, source-agnostic way to copy a declared set of
those files to a stable local location *before* the state directory disappears.

The set of files to keep is declared once by the caller as a list of
:class:`PreservedItem` (paths relative to the agent state directory). The same
declaration is executed against either:

- an online host (:class:`~imbue.mngr.interfaces.host.OnlineHostInterface`),
  reading over SSH / locally and using rsync for directories, or
- a stopped-but-volume-backed host
  (:class:`~imbue.mngr.hosts.offline_host.OfflineHostWithVolume`), reading from
  the host's persisted volume.

Both are :class:`~imbue.mngr.interfaces.host.HostFileReadInterface`, so callers
do not branch on online-vs-offline: they pass whichever host they hold and the
single :func:`preserve_agent_data` call does the right thing. Preserved files
mirror the agent-state-dir layout verbatim under the destination root.

Destruction is also the last chance to *produce* data worth keeping, so the
online path (:func:`preserve_agent_state`) first runs each transcript
producer's final bounded pass (:func:`flush_agent_transcript`) and then copies.

What was preserved is recorded next to the files as a
:class:`PreservationManifest`: who the agent was and where it ran
(:class:`PreservedAgentIdentity`), what each declared item's copy attempt
observed, and what those final producer passes reported. An archive outlives
every process that could answer those questions, so nothing about it can be
looked up again afterwards.

The read side walks that storage: :func:`discover_preserved_agent_archives`
returns every archive under a local host dir (manifest-backed, and the
pre-manifest ones identified by directory name),
:func:`read_preservation_manifest` reads one archive's manifest, and
:func:`preserved_agent_matches` addresses an archive by agent name or id.
