# mngr tmr

**Synopsis:**

```text
mngr tmr [TEST_PATHS...] [-- TESTING_FLAGS...] [--name <VARIANT>] [--mapper-prompt <FILE>] [--reducer-prompt <FILE>] [--provider <PROVIDER>] [--env KEY=VALUE] [--reducer-env KEY=VALUE] [--label KEY=VALUE] [--timeout <SECS>] [--agent-type <TYPE>]
```

Run and fix tests in parallel using agents (test map-reduce).

This command implements a map-reduce pattern for tests:

1. Collects tests using pytest --collect-only, passing through all arguments.
2. Launches one agent per test. Each agent runs the test and, if it fails,
   attempts to diagnose and fix either the test code or the implementation.
3. Polls agents until all finish or individually time out (per-agent timeout).
   An HTML report is updated continuously during polling.
4. For successful fixes, pulls the agent's code changes into branches
   named tmr/<run>/*.
5. If any fixes succeeded, launches a reducer agent to merge all fix
   branches into a single integrated branch (tmr/<run>/reducer). The reducer
   also collapses changes many agents made identically into one shared fix,
   writes the run's changelog entry, and -- when given a GH_TOKEN via
   --reducer-env -- opens the run's pull request.
6. Generates a final HTML report summarizing all outcomes with markdown
   summaries, including the integrated branch name if applicable.

Each agent reports an outcome JSON with the changes it made (each SUCCEEDED or
FAILED) and an `escalations` list. Escalations are independent of the outcome:
an agent whose test passes cleanly still raises one when it finds a problem
beyond its own test, such as the same fix already present on sibling tests.

Arguments before -- are test paths/patterns (positional). Arguments after -- are
pytest testing flags shared between discovery and individual test runs. For example:

mngr tmr tests/e2e -- -m release

This discovers tests with `pytest --collect-only tests/e2e -m release` and runs
each test with `pytest --timeout=120 tests/e2e/test_foo.py::test_bar -m release`.
The explicit timeout is the same budget the reducer verifies at, so agents do
not have to add per-test timeout markers (a test needing longer is escalated).

Use --name to give a run its own variant prefix (agent/branch/host names), so
distinct suites stay separable and reviewable on their own. For example, run the
mngr suite and the minds suite as separate variants:

mngr tmr libs/mngr --name tmr-mngr -- -m "release and not docker and not docker_sdk"
  mngr tmr apps/minds --name tmr-minds -- -m "release and not minds_deployment and not minds_services and not minds_snapshot_resume"

Use --mapper-prompt / --reducer-prompt to point a variant at its own Jinja
prompt templates (they may extend or include the packaged ones by name).

Use --provider to run agents on a specific provider (e.g. docker, modal).
On providers that support snapshots (e.g. modal), the orchestrator
automatically builds and provisions one host, snapshots it, then launches
all remaining agents from that snapshot. Pass --snapshot <ID> to reuse an
existing snapshot instead of building one.
Use --env to pass environment variables and --label to tag all agents.
Use --max-parallel-agents to limit how many agents run simultaneously (0 = no limit).

Each agent writes its result to .test_output/testing_agent_outcome.json (in its work directory)
with a structured JSON containing: changes (list of kind/status/summary), errored flag,
tests_passing_before/after booleans, and a markdown summary.

## Arguments

- `PYTEST_ARGS`: Additional arguments passed through

**Options:**

## Common

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--format` | text | Output format (human, json, jsonl, FORMAT): Output format for results. When a template is provided, fields use standard python templating like 'name: {agent.name}' See below for available fields. | `human` |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | boolean | Suppress all console output | `False` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | integer range | Increase verbosity (default: BUILD); -v for DEBUG, -vv for TRACE | `0` |
| `--log-file` | path | Path to log file (overrides default ~/.mngr/events/logs/<timestamp>-<pid>.json) | None |
| `--log-commands`, `--no-log-commands` | boolean | Log commands that were executed | None |
| `--headless` | boolean | Disable all interactive behavior (prompts, TUI, editor). Also settable via MNGR_HEADLESS env var or 'headless' config key. | `False` |
| `--safe` | boolean | Always query all providers during discovery (disable event-stream optimization). Use this when interfacing with mngr from multiple machines. | `False` |
| `--plugin`, `--enable-plugin` | text | Enable a plugin [repeatable] | None |
| `--disable-plugin` | text | Disable a plugin [repeatable] | None |
| `-S`, `--setting` | text | Override a config setting for this invocation (KEY=VALUE, dot-separated paths; append __extend to the leaf key to extend list/dict/set fields) [repeatable] | None |
| `-h`, `--help` | boolean | Show this message and exit. | `False` |

## Other Options

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--name` | text | Variant name, used as the prefix for this run's agent/branch/host names (e.g. tmr-mngr, tmr-minds) so distinct test suites stay separable and reviewable on their own. Distinct from --run-name, which identifies one run within a variant. | `tmr` |
| `--mapper-prompt` | file | Override the packaged mapper prompt with this Jinja template file. It may '{% extends %}' or '{% include %}' the packaged mapper.j2 by name. | None |
| `--reducer-prompt` | file | Override the packaged reducer prompt with this Jinja template file. It may '{% extends %}' or '{% include %}' the packaged reducer.j2 by name. | None |
| `--agent-type` | text | Type of agent to launch for each task | `claude` |
| `-t`, `--agent-template` | text | Create template to apply for mapper agents [repeatable, stacks in order] | None |
| `--provider` | text | Provider for agent hosts (e.g. local, docker, modal). Used for both mappers and the reducer. | `local` |
| `--reducer-env` | text | Environment variable KEY=VALUE to pass to the reducer ONLY, not to mappers. For credentials the reducer needs but mappers must not receive (e.g. a token that can push and open pull requests) [repeatable] | None |
| `--reducer-branch-suffix` | text | Suffix appended to the reducer's branch/agent/host names. Set this on a reintegration so its pull request is opened from a branch that does not collide with the original run's reducer branch (the two share a run name). Blank for a normal run. | `` |
| `--env` | text | Environment variable KEY=VALUE to pass to agents [repeatable] | None |
| `--label` | text | Agent label KEY=VALUE to attach to all launched agents [repeatable] | None |
| `--snapshot` | text | Use an existing snapshot/image ID for all agents (skips building a fresh snapshot) | None |
| `--max-parallel-launch` | integer | Maximum number of agents to launch concurrently (launch-time parallelism) | `10` |
| `--agents-per-host` | integer | Number of agents sharing each remote host (ignored for local provider) | `4` |
| `--max-parallel-agents` | integer | Maximum number of mappers running at any one time (0 = no limit). When set, mappers are launched incrementally as earlier ones finish. | `0` |
| `--launch-delay` | float | Seconds to wait between launching each agent (avoids provider rate limits) | `2.0` |
| `--poll-interval` | float | Seconds between polling cycles when waiting for agents to finish | `60.0` |
| `--timeout` | float | Maximum seconds each mapper can run before being stopped (per-agent timeout) | `3600.0` |
| `--reducer-timeout` | float | Maximum seconds to wait for the reducer agent to finish | `3600.0` |
| `--output-dir` | path | Directory for the run's outputs (HTML report at index.html, per-agent artifacts) [default: <recipe>_<timestamp>/] | None |
| `--source` | directory | Source directory for discovery and agent work dirs [default: current directory] | None |
| `--reintegrate` | boolean | Re-read outcomes from a previous run, re-run the reducer, and regenerate the report. Skips discovery and mapper launching. The run to reintegrate is identified by --run-name. | `False` |
| `--run-name` | text | The run name. For new runs, overrides the auto-generated UTC YYYYMMDDHHMMSS timestamp; must not collide with prior runs whose agents are still discoverable. For --reintegrate, identifies which previous run to reintegrate (required). | None |
| `--additional-authorized-host` | text | SSH public key line to install in authorized_keys on each agent host (mappers, reducer, host pool, and snapshotter), allowing inbound SSH [repeatable] | None |
