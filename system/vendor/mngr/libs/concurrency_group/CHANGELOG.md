## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: Optional `name` parameter on `RunningProcess` and the `run_process_to_completion` / `run_process_in_background` / `run_background` spawn APIs — a log-safe label used as the reader thread's name and as the display command in any `ProcessError` / `TimeoutExpired` raised. Callers whose command carries secret argument values (e.g. `--host-env PASSWORD=...`) can pass a masked/friendly `name` so those secrets never reach the JSONL log's `thread_name` field or an error message; the real argv still executes. Defaults to the joined command. `ProcessError` gains a `display_name` (and a `display_command` property) used for its rendered message while `.command` keeps the real argv; `FinishedProcess` gains a matching `display_name`.
- Added: Optional `pass_fds` parameter on `ConcurrencyGroup.run_process_in_background`, `run_background`, and `run_local_command_modern_version`, forwarded to `subprocess.Popen(pass_fds=...)` so callers can hand an already-connected `socketpair` endpoint to a child process without a rendezvous file on disk.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Subprocess shutdown logging no longer misreports routine cleanup as a forced kill. A process that already exited by the time its shutdown is requested (the common case for single-use workers) is reaped quietly with a debug line stating its actual exit code, instead of logging a SIGTERM. When a live process is genuinely stopped, the log message now states the reason explicitly ("Stopping subprocess (pid ...) with SIGTERM because it exceeded its <N>s timeout" or "... because the parent requested cleanup (shutdown_event was set)"), so a routine cancellation is no longer misread as a timeout.

## [v0.1.20] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Changed: Concurrency-group exception handling now raises a dedicated custom exception type instead of `ValueError`.

## [v0.1.19] - 2026-06-05

## [v0.1.18] - 2026-05-28

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed: Background processes started via `ConcurrencyGroup.run_process_in_background()` now default to `is_checked_by_group=True`, so non-zero exits surface as `ProcessError` at group teardown instead of being silently swallowed.
