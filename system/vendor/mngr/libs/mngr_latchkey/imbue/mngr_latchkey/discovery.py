"""Agent-lifecycle callbacks that wire the shared gateway into each agent.

Exposes two callables:

* :class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` -- on every agent discovery, ensures
  the shared desktop ``latchkey gateway`` subprocess is up and exposes exactly
  one gateway on the agent's ``127.0.0.1:AGENT_SIDE_LATCHKEY_PORT``. Local
  workspaces receive the desktop gateway directly. Remote workspaces receive
  the VPS gateway, while a separate desktop-to-VPS tunnel lets its forwarding
  extension reach Minds-owned endpoints on the desktop. A workspace whose
  gateway location cannot be resolved yet receives *neither*: guessing the
  desktop gateway would half-work while exposing it to a workspace that is not
  entitled to it (see ``_warn_unresolved_gateway_route``).
* :class:`LatchkeyDestructionHandler` -- on every agent destruction,
  tears down the reverse tunnel that belongs to that agent so the
  manager's health-check loop doesn't keep spinning paramiko transports
  against an SSH host that no longer exists.

Tunnel setup is dispatched onto a worker thread via the supplied
``ConcurrencyGroup`` so the discovery-stream reader thread is never
blocked on slow SSH I/O. Concurrent fires for the same agent are
coalesced via ``_pending_remote_agents``: the underlying
``setup_reverse_tunnel`` is already idempotent on
``(host:port, local_port)``, so a duplicate fire would do no harm,
but coalescing avoids spinning up a redundant worker just to find an
existing tunnel and exit.

        Nothing is wired for such a host: its in-container gateway port stays

        cycle resolves the route. That is deliberately worse-looking than
        tunnelling the desktop gateway in as a guess, which is what this used to
        do, because for a VPS-backed workspace that guess is actively harmful:

        * It half-works, and therefore hides the problem. Requests that are not
          permission-checked (the ``/latchkey/`` RPC) succeed, while every
          third-party call and extension route is denied -- the workspace has no
          permissions-override JWT (its policy lives on the VPS), so the desktop
          gateway evaluates it against its deny-all default file.
        * It exposes the desktop gateway to the workspace. ``/latchkey/`` is
          gated by the shared password alone, so the workspace can enumerate the
          user's services, accounts and credential status, and start auth flows
          on the user's own machine.
        * It squats the container's ``AGENT_SIDE_LATCHKEY_PORT``, which the
          VPS->container tunnel has to bind, so provisioning then has to tear
          down a tunnel we opened ourselves.

        Resolution normally succeeds on the first try for desktop hosts
        (their providers answer without network I/O), so "unresolved" almost
        always means the provider lookup itself failed -- i.e. we know nothing
        about this host, and wiring nothing is the honest response.

        Warn on the first occurrence per host and drop to debug afterwards, so a
        persistent problem is visible without flooding the log on every cycle.
