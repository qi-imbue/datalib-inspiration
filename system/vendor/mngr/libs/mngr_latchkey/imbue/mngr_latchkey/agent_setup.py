"""High-level helpers for wiring latchkey into a freshly-created agent.

The lifecycle for a new agent has three latchkey-aware steps:

1. *Before* ``mngr create``: allocate an opaque permissions handle,
   materialize it with a deny-by-default baseline, and assemble the env vars
   the agent needs. Desktop-gateway workspaces also receive a
   permissions-override JWT pointing at the handle; VPS-gateway workspaces use
   the remote gateway's synchronized default permissions file instead. See
   :func:`prepare_agent_latchkey`.

2. *After* ``mngr create`` returns the canonical host id: replace the
   opaque handle with a symlink to the canonical host-keyed
   ``latchkey_permissions.json`` so the desktop's permission-grant flow
   writes to the canonical path while the gateway reads through the
   symlink. See :func:`finalize_host_permissions`.

3. (Out of scope here.) When the agent is later discovered, the
   :class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` ensures the shared gateway is up
   and reverse-tunnels it into the agent for non-DEV launches.

Both helpers raise on failure (``LatchkeyError`` from the upstream
CLI, ``LatchkeyStoreError`` from on-disk persistence). Callers decide
whether to fail agent creation or just surface a warning -- the helpers
themselves don't make that policy call.

The one place ``prepare_agent_latchkey`` *does* tolerate an absent
dependency is when ``latchkey`` itself is ``None``: that's a degraded
test / no-password-gateway mode where we still produce the constant
agent-side gateway URL but skip the password / JWT / opaque-handle
steps that need a working ``Latchkey``.

# cannot divert a request that already looks like ``/gateway/<url>``.
#
# Its value differs by topology, and the empty string is the meaningful default:

# * VPS-gateway hosts get ``https://latchkey-self.invalid/via-desktop``.
#   Prepending it produces a URL the latchkey CLI rewrites onto the VPS

    gateway's synchronized default ``permissions.json``; its forwarding
    extension adds a separate desktop-target JWT only on the desktop hop.

    It also decides ``MINDS_VIA_DESKTOP_URL_PREFIX``: VPS-gateway hosts get a
    real prefix to route an outbound request back through the user's machine,
    desktop-gateway hosts get the empty string because they already egress
    there (see :data:`ENV_MINDS_VIA_DESKTOP_URL_PREFIX`).

    No-op when ``opaque_permissions_path`` is ``None`` -- that's the
    sentinel :func:`prepare_agent_latchkey` returns in the
    no-``Latchkey`` degraded mode, in which case there is nothing to
    finalize.

    Raises :class:`LatchkeyStoreError` if the linking fails. Callers
    decide whether to surface the failure or carry on: if the link
    isn't established, the agent's gateway requests still evaluate
    against the deny-all baseline file the JWT references directly
    (the opaque file itself, which already exists), but subsequent
    UI-driven permission grants will not take effect because the UI
    writes to the canonical host-keyed path that this function would
    have linked.

    Deliberately does **not** push the result to the host's machine,
    unlike every other writer of the canonical file (see
    :func:`~imbue.mngr_latchkey.remote.credentials.read_host_permissions`).
    What it promotes is a deny-all baseline, never a grant, so pushing it
    would overwrite whatever policy the machine is already enforcing --
    including grants another of the user's computers made. Seeding a
    machine that has no policy of its own is provisioning's job
    (:func:`~imbue.mngr_latchkey.remote.provisioning.sync_permissions`).

    """Repair a host's permissions file (and re-register ``agent_id``) when needed.

    Cheap in the common case: when the canonical file already exists this
    only re-registers the agent (an idempotent read, usually a no-op),
    which is why the name carries the ``maybe_`` hedge -- the expensive
    link / write paths run only on the rare missing-file case.

    A best-effort safety net for the rare case where an agent is live and
    able to file permission requests (its gateway JWT resolves to the
    opaque handle ``opaque_permissions_path``) but the canonical
    host-keyed permissions file was never materialized -- e.g. agent
    creation's :func:`finalize_host_permissions` step was skipped or
    failed. In that state a UI-driven grant would write to a non-existent
    ``hosts/<host_id>/`` directory, and even once that directory exists
    the agent would not see grants written there because its JWT still
    points at the standalone opaque handle.

    Two repairs happen here:

    1. If the canonical permissions file is missing, it is materialized
       from the opaque handle (moving the deny-all baseline into the
       canonical path and swinging the handle to a symlink pointing at
       it, via :func:`finalize_host_permissions`).
    2. ``agent_id`` is (idempotently) registered for the host via
       :func:`register_agent_for_host`. This always runs -- even when the
       file already existed -- because the discovery-time auto-register
       only ever *waits* for a host file to appear, never creates one: an
       agent on a host whose file was never materialized is left out of
       the ``minds-api-proxy`` allowlist until something repairs the file,
       and repair 1 above is that something.

    ``opaque_permissions_path`` is the path the agent's
    permissions-override JWT resolves to; minds reads it from the
    gateway-streamed permission request's ``target`` field. It must live
    under the plugin's opaque permissions directory (the only place this
    function is willing to move from / symlink), otherwise
    :class:`LatchkeyStoreError` is raised.

    Returns ``True`` if the canonical file had to be materialized,
    ``False`` if it already existed (the common case -- a cheap check on
    the hot path). The return value reflects only the file repair;
    registration is idempotent and runs in both cases.

    Raises:
        LatchkeyStoreError: if ``opaque_permissions_path`` is outside the
            opaque permissions directory, or the underlying link / write /
            registration fails.
