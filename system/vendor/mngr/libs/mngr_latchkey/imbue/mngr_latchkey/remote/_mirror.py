"""Per-machine latchkey stores: one ``LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY`` per remote host.

A remote host's credentials belong to *its own machine* (the VPS), not to the
user's computer: only the machine that holds a refresh token may rotate it, and
a machine that can rotate its own tokens keeps working while the user's computer
is offline. The VPS's ``~/.latchkey`` is therefore the source of truth for that
host, and the desktop keeps a local **machine store** -- a mirror that is also a
usable ``LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY``, so every read a caller needs (``services info
--offline``, ``auth list --offline``) is answered from disk instead of over the
network.

The machine store is the per-host directory this plugin already owns::

    <latchkey_directory>/mngr_latchkey/hosts/<host_id>/
        credentials.json.enc          mirror of the machine's store  (owned)
        data-format-version           the mirror's own format stamp  (owned)
        latchkey_permissions.json     canonical per-host policy      (owned)
        machine_encryption_key        the machine's own key          (owned)
        machine_gateway_password      the machine's own password     (owned)
        permissions.json           -> latchkey_permissions.json
        config.json                -> the desktop's config.json
        browser_state.json.enc     -> the desktop's browser state
        encryption_key             -> the desktop's encryption key
        last-daily-count           -> the desktop's usage-ping stamp

What is *shared* with the desktop is shared by symlink, so there is one copy on
disk and no reconciliation. The links are relative, so the tree survives being
moved or copied.

Three things are worth knowing:

* **A mirror is held under the desktop's key, not the mirrored machine's.**
  Upstream encrypts the browser state with the same per-directory key as the
  credential store, so a machine store can only reuse the desktop's browser
  session -- which is what keeps signing a second machine in to a service down
  to a consent click rather than a full re-login -- while it also uses the
  desktop's key. Each machine keeps its own key for its own store; the key
  changes at the transfer boundary instead, by re-encrypting on the way in and
  on the way out.

* **A machine store is not a plugin root.** ``Latchkey.plugin_data_dir`` would
  resolve to a *nested* ``mngr_latchkey/`` underneath it, so a machine store
  must never be handed to :meth:`Latchkey.initialize` (which also rewrites
  ``config.json`` -- here a symlink into the desktop's). Only the
  credential/service-introspection subset of :class:`Latchkey` is meaningful
  against one.

* **Nothing may replace a link with a regular file.** Writes must go *through*
  the symlinks (``atomic_write_bytes`` resolves them before renaming); a plain
  write-and-rename would silently fork the shared state.
