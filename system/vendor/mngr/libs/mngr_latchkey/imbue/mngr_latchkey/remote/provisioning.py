"""Provision the latchkey CLI (and its runtime prerequisites) on a remote VPS.

Remote workspaces receive the gateway managed here, while local workspaces
receive the desktop gateway directly. The VPS gateway handles third-party
calls itself and forwards Minds-owned endpoint families back to the desktop.

The VPS-resident gateway and the VPS->container reverse SSH tunnel are both
long-running processes that must survive crashes and VM pause/resume. Rather
than spawn them detached (``nohup`` + a PID-file guard), they are registered as
``supervisord`` programs: ``supervisord`` is installed from the distro package
and auto-restarts either process if it dies. The SSH tunnel additionally
carries keepalive flags so a connection wedged by a paused-then-resumed VM is
detected and torn down, letting ``supervisord`` restart it.

Crash recovery deliberately stops short of surviving a full *reboot*: the
gateway's secrets (the machine's own encryption key and listen password, plus
the pair its forwarding extension presents to the desktop) are
kept in a tmpfs directory under ``/run``, which is RAM-backed and so survives
process crashes -- letting ``supervisord`` restart the gateway without a
desktop round-trip -- but is wiped by a reboot. This is a deliberate choice to
never persist the encryption key on the VPS disk beside the encrypted
credential store (which would be equivalent to storing the credentials in
plaintext from a disk-snapshot threat model). Provisioning verifies the
directory really is RAM-backed and refuses to proceed otherwise, so the key is
never written to a disk filesystem by mistake. After a reboot the gateway
stays down until the next provisioning pass re-writes the secrets.

# marker header gets Chrome TLS impersonation, while every other request
# passes through to the system curl. The statically linked musl build is
# fetched rather than the glibc one, so it runs on any VPS image regardless of
# how old its glibc is. The fetch is fail-loud, like every other component of
# the install: a network failure, a checksum mismatch, or a host arch datalib
# doesn't build fails provisioning. The gateway run script exports

    supervisord invokes this as ``/bin/sh <script>``. It reads the encryption key
    and the gateway listen password from 0600 tmpfs files into their respective
    environment variables and ``exec``s the gateway (so supervisord tracks the
    gateway PID directly, not a wrapping shell). Reading the secrets from files
    -- rather than baking them into the supervisord ``command=`` line -- keeps
    them out of the config file and out of any process listing
    (``/proc/<pid>/cmdline``). The gateway binds ``outer_port`` on the VPS
    loopback only; it is reached from the container via the reverse tunnel, never
    exposed off-host.

    The secret files live in tmpfs (see :data:`TMPFS_SECRETS_DIR`), so a reboot
    wipes them. The script therefore refuses to launch a gateway with missing
    secrets: it exits non-zero with a clear message, which supervisord treats as
    a failed start (the gateway stays down until the next provisioning pass
    re-writes the secrets) rather than running a broken, keyless gateway.

    ``LATCHKEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` is this machine's own key, which is what its
    ``credentials.json.enc`` is encrypted with, and
    ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD`` is the machine's own listen password,
    which the agents on it present as ``LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD``.

    The desktop-owned pair is handed over as *paths*, not values: the forwarding
    extension reads them on every request it proxies, so a provisioning pass
    from another of the user's computers takes effect without this gateway (and
    the workspace it is serving) having to be restarted. Their absence is
    therefore not a launch failure either -- the extension answers the
    desktop-owned routes with a 503 that says so, while third-party calls, which
    need neither, keep working.

    The gateway refreshes its own OAuth credentials, because the store here is
    this machine's own rather than a copy of anyone else's: nothing else holds
    the refresh tokens in it, so nothing else can race it to rotate one -- and a
    machine that renews its own tokens keeps working while the user's computer

    supervisord keeps the gateway running and restarts it if it crashes. This

    present the password from a host env file written once, at ``mngr create``,
    and nothing rewrites that file for the life of the workspace. Whichever of
    the user's computers created them therefore fixed the value, and a second

    rebooted (wiping its own copy) before this computer -- not the one that

    anywhere still knows the value they were given. Their latchkey calls stay
    unauthorized; a build that records the password while the machine is still
    running closes the window for good.
