"""Detached supervisor for the ``mngr latchkey forward`` subprocess.

Owns the on-disk record + adoption logic for a single, long-running
``mngr latchkey forward`` process. The supervisor itself is *not* the
forward subprocess -- it's a tiny in-process helper that callers (the
minds desktop client, future GUI clients) use to make sure exactly one
detached ``mngr latchkey forward`` is running for a given latchkey
directory.

Why this exists: ``mngr latchkey forward`` is the canonical owner of the
shared gateway + per-agent reverse-tunnel lifecycle. Embedders that want
the same behaviour without re-implementing :class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler`
/ :class:`LatchkeyDestructionHandler` / :class:`SSHTunnelManager` wiring
can simply spawn ``mngr latchkey forward`` detached and reuse it across
embedder restarts. The detachment + adoption mechanics mirror what
:class:`Latchkey` already does for the gateway itself, so reading both
side-by-side is intentional.

        and exits. Embedders that want the gateway to *survive* their
        own shutdown should simply not call this method.

          our own freshly-spawned PID. Terminated without a cmdline

          cmdline matches) before terminating. A record that points
