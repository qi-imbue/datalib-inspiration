/**
 * Latchkey gateway extension: HTTP endpoints for managing pending
 * permission requests.
 *
 * Endpoints:
 *   POST   /permission-requests
 *       Create a new pending permission request. Body is a JSON object
 *       with the fields:
 *         - ``agent_id``   (string, required)
 *         - ``rationale``  (string, required)
 *         - ``type``       (one of "predefined" | "file-sharing" | "workspace")
 *         - ``payload``    (object whose shape depends on ``type``)
 *       For ``type=="predefined"`` the payload is
 *         ``{scope: <string>, permissions: [<string>, ...],
 *           account: <string>|null}``,
 *       a detent-flavored scope/permission grant for one signed-in
 *       account of the service. The scope must be one of the Detent
 *       scopes named in the bundled ``services.json`` catalog, and
 *       every entry in ``permissions`` must be one of the
 *       permission-schema names the catalog lists under that scope;
 *       otherwise the request is rejected with HTTP 400.
 *       ``account`` names the latchkey account the grant applies to
 *       (the unnamed default account is the empty string). It is
 *       optional -- an agent that does not know which account (or
 *       whether any account exists at all) omits it and the user picks
 *       one when approving. A request with no account has an *empty*
 *       ``effect``: it can only be resolved by a client that supplies
 *       the chosen account in the approve override body, never by a
 *       bare ``/approve`` call.
 *       For ``type=="file-sharing"`` the payload is
 *         ``{path: <absolute_or_tilde_path>}``;
 *       the path must be absolute (start with ``/``) or use ``~`` /
 *       ``~/...`` to denote the current user's home directory (which is
 *       expanded to an absolute path before storage), and must not
 *       contain any ``..`` segments (rejected as a path-traversal
 *       attempt). ``~user`` notation for another user's home is
 *       rejected.
 *       For ``type=="workspace"`` the payload is
 *         ``{permissions: [<verb>, ...], target_workspace_id: <id>|null}``;
 *       each verb must be one of the ``minds-workspaces`` verb schema
 *       names (read / create / destroy / lifecycle / backups-export /
 *       ssh / update / recover / sharing) and ``target_workspace_id``
 *       (the workspace the targeted
 *       verbs act on) is optional and, when present, must be a valid
 *       agent id. The effect is a self-contained patch (scope + verb
 *       schemas + rule) applied via ``/approve`` like file-sharing;
 *       each selected target becomes a uniquely-named verb schema, so
 *       repeated grants accumulate targets through the schema-by-name
 *       merge (no ``anyOf``). The approve override body
 *       (``{permissions, target_workspace_id}``) recomputes the effect
 *       from the user's dialog choices (verb subset + all-vs-selected).
 *
 *       The extension also stores, alongside the user-supplied fields:
 *         - ``request_id`` (server-generated, UUIDv4 hex)
 *         - ``target``     (extension-context permissionsConfigPath: the
 *                          permissions.json file an approval would modify)
 *         - ``effect``     (precomputed ``{rules?, schemas?}`` object that
 *                          POST ``/permission-requests/approve/<id>``
 *                          will splice into the target permissions.json)
 *
 *   GET    /permission-requests
 *       List all pending permission requests as newline-delimited JSON
 *       (one object per line, ``application/x-ndjson``). Each line has
 *       the full persisted shape described above.
 *       With ``?follow=true`` the connection is kept open and every
 *       request newly created via this extension's POST endpoint is
 *       streamed as an additional JSONL line until the client
 *       disconnects. Filesystem changes made by anything other than
 *       the POST handler are not observed.
 *
 *   POST   /permission-requests/approve/<request_id>
 *       Approve the named request by splicing its ``effect`` into the
 *       stored ``target`` permissions.json (creating the file if it
 *       does not yet exist). Schemas are merged into the
 *       ``schemas`` object by name (overwriting on collision); rules
 *       are merged into the ``rules`` array by scope key (union of the
 *       permission list when the scope already had a rule, otherwise
 *       appended). After a successful write, the pending request file
 *       is deleted. Returns ``200`` with the freshly-applied
 *       permissions config in the body.
 *
 *   DELETE /permission-requests/<request_id>
 *       Remove the named pending request (used by the desktop client
 *       for the deny flow, and as a forget-without-grant escape hatch).
 *
 * Each pending request is stored as a single JSON file at
 * ``<latchkey-directory>/permission_requests/v3/<request_id>.json``,
 * where ``<latchkey-directory>`` is ``LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY`` if set,
 * otherwise ``~/.latchkey``. The ``v3`` segment is the on-disk schema
 * version; future shape changes get a new directory rather than
 * trying to migrate files in place. (``v3`` introduced the per-account
 * ``predefined`` payload and its account-scoped effect.)
 *
 * NOTE: extension requests still go through the gateway's permission
 * check, so callers must have a rule that allows them to talk to
 * ``latchkey-self.invalid`` on the relevant method/path. The agent
 * baseline grants ``POST /permission-requests`` only; the
 * ``/approve`` endpoint is meant to be reached from the desktop client
 * with admin-override credentials.
 *
 * There are potential race conditions but we ignore them for now.
