"""Verb metadata for the cross-workspace ``minds-workspaces`` API.

Minds exposes a small cross-workspace management API
(``/api/v1/workspaces/...``) that an agent in one workspace can call to act on
*other* workspaces -- listing them, reading detail, creating, destroying,
starting/stopping, exporting and managing backups, establishing SSH access,
updating settings, recovering (health check / restart), and managing service
sharing. Those calls
are reached through the gateway's bundled ``minds-api-proxy`` extension (so the
detent envelope's domain is the synthetic ``latchkey-self.invalid`` gateway-self
host) and granted by unioning one named permission per verb onto the domain-only
``latchkey-self`` scope (like file-sharing and accounts), so no dedicated detent
scope is minted.

The verb catalog -- the verb permission-schema names, their targeted/non-targeted
split, and the dialog labels -- lives in a single shared data file,
``extensions/workspace_permissions.json``, read by *both* this module (for the
dialog-facing metadata) and the gateway's ``permission_requests.mjs`` extension
(for the request-path schema construction). Keeping one source of truth means the
two sides cannot drift; an integration check in ``permission_requests_test.py``
confirms the gateway accepts exactly the verbs this module exposes.

The actual permission *effect* (the per-verb schemas + the grant rule attaching
them to ``latchkey-self``) is computed in that gateway extension and applied
through the standard ``POST /permission-requests/approve`` path, so no schema
construction lives here.

The verbs split on a target axis:

* ``read`` and ``create`` are all-or-nothing (listing is not per-workspace and
  create takes no target).
* ``destroy``, ``lifecycle``, ``backups-export``, ``backups-manage``, ``ssh``,
  ``update``, ``recover``, and ``sharing`` are target-scoped: each approval mints
  a uniquely-named per-target verb schema, so granting access to another
  workspace accumulates rather than replaces.
