"""Read-only access to the bundled latchkey service catalog (``services.json``).

``services.json`` ships beside the gateway permissions extension
(``imbue.mngr_latchkey.extensions``). It is a JSON object keyed by *raw*
canonical service name (``slack``, ``github``, ``google-gmail``, ...).
Each value is a list of scope entries, each with a ``scope`` field naming
the Detent scope schema -- the very string that appears as a rule key in
a per-host ``permissions.json`` (``{"slack-api": [...]}``) and that an
agent's permission request carries -- plus a human-readable
``display_name``, an optional ``description`` (Detent's ``$comment``),
and the grantable ``permissions`` (each with its own optional
description). A single service may expose more than one scope (e.g.
``github`` -> ``github-rest-api``, ``github-git``).

The file is generated (see ``scripts/generate_services_json.py``) from detent's
builtin request schemas *plus* minds' own additional (custom) services, so this
module -- and the gateway extensions that read the same file -- never have to
know which of the two a service came from.

This module is the single chokepoint for that file. All access goes
through :class:`ServicesCatalog`, which serves two layers:

* The credential-sync path (:mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.remote`) uses
  :meth:`ServicesCatalog.services_for_permissions` /
  :meth:`ServicesCatalog.all_service_names` to map the scopes a host has
  been granted back to the canonical service names whose credentials
  should be shipped to that host.
* The desktop permission dialog uses :meth:`ServicesCatalog.get` /
  :meth:`ServicesCatalog.get_by_scope` / :meth:`ServicesCatalog.as_mapping`
  (returning :class:`ServicePermissionInfo`) to render a granted scope
  with its display name and the checkbox list of grantable permissions.
  A surface that names the service as a whole rather than one of its
  scopes reads ``ServicePermissionInfo.service_display_name``.

The dialog used to fetch this from the running gateway's
``GET /permissions/available`` endpoint, but that endpoint was a pure
pass-through of this same file, so the catalog now reads the bundled file
directly -- no gateway, no network, no liveness coupling.

The file is trusted package data copied verbatim into the wheel, so a
missing or malformed file is a packaging bug; it surfaces as
:class:`ServiceCatalogError` rather than being silently tolerated.
