"""Single wrapper around all interactions with the latchkey CLI.

The ``Latchkey`` class consolidates four responsibilities that all
ultimately shell out to the same upstream binary:

1. Spawning, adopting, and tracking the single shared
   ``latchkey gateway`` subprocess (one for all minds-managed agents).
2. Deriving the gateway's shared password and minting per-agent
   permissions-override JWTs via ``latchkey gateway create-jwt``.
3. Probing credential status for a service via ``latchkey services info``.
4. Launching the interactive ``latchkey auth browser`` flow when the user
   needs to authenticate.

Keeping these in one class means there is exactly one place that knows
about the binary path, the shared ``LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY``, and the global
locking concerns, and exactly one place to mock or replace when something
needs to change.

        decrypted with the current per-directory encryption key and a

        In the normal (non-ephemeral) mode the bare sign-in is attempted first,
        rather than probing which client is registered up front, so the two

        single latchkey call. In ephemeral mode (adding a *new* account) the
        bare sign-in is skipped entirely and the prepare path runs unconditionally,
