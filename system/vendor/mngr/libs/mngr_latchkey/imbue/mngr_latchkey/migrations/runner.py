"""Sequences the plugin's data-format migrations against the recorded version.

The plugin stamps the current on-disk data-format version into a
``data-format-version`` file at the root of ``Latchkey.plugin_data_dir``. On every
:meth:`Latchkey.initialize`, :func:`run_data_format_migrations` compares that
recorded version against :data:`CURRENT_DATA_FORMAT_VERSION` (the highest version
the installed code understands) and, if they differ, applies the intervening
:class:`DataFormatMigration` steps in the appropriate direction -- ``apply_up`` to
move a stale-but-older store forward after an upgrade, ``apply_down`` to move a
newer store back after a downgrade -- then rewrites the version file.

A fresh install (no version file, no host data yet) is stamped straight to the
current version: the up-migrations are no-ops against an empty store, so nothing
is rewritten and future migrations get an accurate baseline.

Some migrations also need to look at the *upstream* latchkey state next to the
plugin's own (which accounts have stored credentials, say), so every step is
handed the latchkey directory and binary alongside ``plugin_data_dir``. A step
that only rewrites files ignores them; one that shells out to latchkey does so
only when it actually has something to rewrite, so a startup with nothing to
migrate never pays for it.
