"""The contract every on-disk data-format migration for the plugin implements.

The plugin persists all of its state under ``<latchkey_directory>/mngr_latchkey/``
(``Latchkey.plugin_data_dir``). When the shape of that on-disk state changes in a
way that is not forward/backward compatible, the change is expressed as a
:class:`DataFormatMigration` rather than as ad-hoc repair code sprinkled through
the readers. Each migration knows how to move the data from the version just
below its own up to its own (``apply_up``) and back down again (``apply_down``);
the runner in :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.migrations.runner` sequences them against
the version recorded in the ``data-format-version`` file.

Besides the plugin's own data directory, a migration is handed the latchkey
directory and binary, because rewriting the plugin's state sometimes requires
looking at the *upstream* latchkey state next to it (which accounts have stored
credentials, say). A migration that only needs the files under
``plugin_data_dir`` simply ignores them.
