"""Data-format migration 1: fold the ``minds-workspaces`` scope into ``latchkey-self``.

Earlier builds gave the cross-workspace management API its own ``minds-workspaces``
detent scope. Because that scope and the agent baseline's ``latchkey-self`` scope
both match on the gateway-self ``domain`` alone, two same-domain rules ended up in
a host's ``latchkey_permissions.json``, and detent's first-matching-scope-wins
evaluation made the rule *order* load-bearing (a domain-only catch-all placed first
would shadow and veto the narrower grant). The workspace verbs now attach as
permissions on the single ``latchkey-self`` scope instead -- like file-sharing and
accounts -- so there is only ever one gateway-self rule and order is irrelevant.

This migration rewrites existing per-host permissions files into the new shape:
``apply_up`` unions each file's ``minds-workspaces`` permission names onto its
``latchkey-self`` rule and drops the now-defunct ``minds-workspaces`` rule and
scope schema; ``apply_down`` reverses it, moving the workspace verb permissions
back into a dedicated ``minds-workspaces`` rule and reconstructing its scope
schema. The per-verb permission schemas (keyed by verb name) are untouched in
both directions -- only which scope rule references them changes.

Everything the migration needs -- the permissions-file model, the read/write, and
the per-host file walk -- is a small frozen copy local to this module rather than
an import from :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.store`. A migration is a historical
artifact: pinning it to its own copies means it keeps performing the exact same
rewrite even if the live store model, its serialization, or the on-disk layout
later changes (such a change would ship as its own, later migration).
