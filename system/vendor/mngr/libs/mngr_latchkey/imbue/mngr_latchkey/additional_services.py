"""Read-only access to the bundled catalog of *additional* latchkey services.

Additional services are third-party services that are **not** part of
latchkey's builtin catalog (``services.json``, generated from detent's builtin
request schemas). minds registers each one in latchkey's ``config.json`` (the
``registeredServices`` block ``latchkey services register`` writes) and ships
its detent scope/permission schemas itself, so an agent can request and be
granted access to it exactly like a builtin service.

The data ships as ``additional_services.json`` beside this module, keyed by
canonical service name. Each value carries the human-readable ``display_name``,
the ``registration`` latchkey stores for the service, the single Detent
``scope`` the service exposes (its schema-name plus the inline scope schema),
and the ``permissions`` grantable under it (each with an inline permission
schema).

``registration`` is written in latchkey's *own* shape -- it is the value that
lands verbatim under ``registeredServices.<name>`` in latchkey's config, so a
service is described here the same way ``latchkey services register`` would
persist it. This module therefore neither models nor validates its contents:
latchkey owns that schema and checks it when it loads the config, and a field a
later latchkey release adds (a ``serviceFamily``, another login flow's params)
reaches the gateway without touching this file's readers.

Nothing reads this file to answer "what services exist": the *catalog* entries
are folded into ``services.json`` by ``scripts/generate_services_json.py``, so
:class:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.services_catalog.ServicesCatalog` and both gateway
extensions see one file in one shape. This file remains the source of the two
things the catalog does not carry:

* the latchkey registration itself --
  :func:`additional_service_registration_entries`, consumed by
  :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.core` to write the ``registeredServices`` block of
  every gateway's ``config.json`` (the desktop's and, via
  :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.remote.provisioning`, each VPS's).
* the inline detent schemas -- :func:`additional_service_schemas`, which the
  agent baseline folds into every host ``permissions.json`` so a granted
  additional-service scope resolves from the file itself.

:func:`additional_services_catalog_payload` exists for the generator, which is
what performs the fold into ``services.json``.

The file is trusted package data copied verbatim into the wheel, so a missing
or malformed file is a packaging bug; it surfaces as
:class:`AdditionalServicesCatalogError` rather than being silently tolerated.
