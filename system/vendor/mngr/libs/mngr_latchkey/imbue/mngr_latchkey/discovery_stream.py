"""Minimal ``mngr observe``-driven discovery dispatcher for ``mngr latchkey forward``.

Spawns a single ``mngr observe --discovery-only --quiet`` subprocess,
parses each JSONL line into a discovery event, and fans the relevant
events out to the two latchkey lifecycle handlers
(:class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` /
:class:`LatchkeyDestructionHandler`).

This is a stripped-down sibling of ``imbue.mngr_forward.stream_manager.ForwardStreamManager``:
it deliberately does *not* spawn per-agent ``mngr event`` subprocesses,
does *not* track service URLs, does *not* feed a resolver, and does
*not* write JSONL envelopes to stdout. The plugin only needs to know
when agents come and go and what their SSH info is, which is exactly
what the ``observe`` discovery stream already carries.

SSH info arrival order is handled the same way ``ForwardStreamManager``
handles it: an agent can be discovered before its host's
``HOST_SSH_INFO`` event arrives, so we re-fire the discovery callback
for every agent on a host whenever that host's SSH info first becomes
available. The downstream :class:`LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler` is already
designed to coalesce duplicate fires for the same agent and to be a
no-op when ``ssh_info is None``.
