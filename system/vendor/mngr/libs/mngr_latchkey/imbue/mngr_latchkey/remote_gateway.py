"""Provision the latchkey CLI (and its runtime prerequisites) on a remote VPS.

Where the rest of the package reverse-tunnels a desktop-side gateway into
each agent, this module installs the upstream ``latchkey`` CLI directly on
the agent's outer host (the VPS) and runs a gateway there.

The VPS-resident gateway and the VPS->container reverse SSH tunnel are both
long-running processes that must survive crashes and VM pause/resume. Rather
than spawn them detached (``nohup`` + a PID-file guard), they are registered as
``supervisord`` programs: ``supervisord`` is installed from the distro package
and auto-restarts either process if it dies. The SSH tunnel additionally
carries keepalive flags so a connection wedged by a paused-then-resumed VM is
detected and torn down, letting ``supervisord`` restart it.

Crash recovery deliberately stops short of surviving a full *reboot*: the
gateway's secrets (the encryption key and the derived listen password) are
kept in a tmpfs directory under ``/run``, which is RAM-backed and so survives
process crashes -- letting ``supervisord`` restart the gateway without a
desktop round-trip -- but is wiped by a reboot. This is a deliberate choice to
never persist the encryption key on the VPS disk beside the encrypted
credential store (which would be equivalent to storing the credentials in
plaintext from a disk-snapshot threat model). Provisioning verifies the
directory really is RAM-backed and refuses to proceed otherwise, so the key is
never written to a disk filesystem by mistake. After a reboot the gateway
stays down until the next provisioning pass re-writes the secrets.
