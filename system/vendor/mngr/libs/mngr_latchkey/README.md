# mngr-latchkey

Latchkey gateway management for [mngr](https://github.com/imbue-ai/mngr).

This package owns the lifecycle of a single shared `latchkey gateway`
subprocess and the per-agent state that points the gateway at each
agent's own permissions file. It ships both as a Python library
and as a `mngr` CLI plugin that registers the `mngr latchkey`
command group.

## CLI

Once `imbue-mngr-latchkey` is installed, `mngr` discovers the plugin
via the standard entry-point mechanism and exposes:

```
mngr latchkey forward            # long-running supervisor: gateway + reverse tunnels
mngr latchkey create-agent-env   # emit LATCHKEY_* env vars + opaque permissions handle as JSON
mngr latchkey link-permissions   # swing the opaque handle's symlink to the canonical host path
mngr latchkey register-agent     # register an agent so it can reach the Minds API proxy
mngr latchkey admin-jwt          # mint a wildcard permissions-override JWT for the gateway
mngr latchkey gateway-info       # print the running gateway's URL + listen password as JSON
```

`mngr latchkey forward` spawns the shared gateway eagerly on startup
and stops it on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` (coupled lifetime). Any in-flight
agents lose their gateway endpoint until the next `mngr latchkey
forward` is started; the per-host permissions files survive across
restarts.

While running, the supervisor also health-checks the shared gateway
subprocess: if it dies mid-session it is respawned on its original
port (so agent reverse tunnels and the published gateway port stay
valid), rather than leaving agent traffic silently broken until the
supervisor itself is restarted.

### Wiring a new agent using the CLI interface

```sh
# In one terminal, leave the supervisor running for the lifetime of the agents.
export MNGR_LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY=~/.minds/latchkey
mngr latchkey forward

# In another terminal, per host:
export MNGR_LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY=~/.minds/latchkey
mngr latchkey create-agent-env > /tmp/lk.json
OPAQUE_PATH=$(jq -r .opaque_permissions_path /tmp/lk.json)
HOST_ENV_ARGS=$(jq -r '.env | to_entries[] | "--host-env \(.key)=\(.value)"' /tmp/lk.json)

# Substitute your preferred mngr create invocation here. The latchkey
# env is passed via --host-env so every agent on the new host inherits
# the same gateway wiring.
CREATED=$(mngr create my-template $HOST_ENV_ARGS --format json)
HOST_ID=$(echo "$CREATED" | jq -r .host_id)
AGENT_ID=$(echo "$CREATED" | jq -r .agent_id)

# Finalize the opaque permissions handle: swing its symlink to the
# canonical host-keyed permissions path.
mngr latchkey link-permissions --host-id "$HOST_ID" --opaque-path "$OPAQUE_PATH"

# Register this agent for the host so it can reach the Minds API proxy.
# The baseline rule rejects every ``/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/agents/<id>/...``
# request whose ``<id>`` is not in the host's allowed-agent enum, so
# every minds agent that wants to call the Minds API must be registered
# here. Idempotent: re-running for an already-registered agent is a no-op.
mngr latchkey register-agent --host-id "$HOST_ID" --agent-id "$AGENT_ID"
```

## Settings

```toml
[plugins.latchkey]
directory = "~/.mngr/latchkey"   # default
latchkey_binary = "latchkey"     # default; resolved via PATH
```

Both fields are overridable via the matching env vars
(`MNGR_LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY`, `MNGR_LATCHKEY_BINARY`) and per-invocation
CLI flags (`--latchkey-directory`, `--latchkey-binary`). Precedence is
CLI flag > env var > settings.toml > built-in default.

## Logs

`mngr latchkey forward` writes its logs under the plugin data directory
(`<latchkey_directory>/mngr_latchkey/`):

- `events.jsonl` -- the supervisor's **structured** log, written via the
  standard mngr/minds JSONL sink: one flat JSON object per line with a
  nanosecond `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, and source location,
  size-rotated (rotated copies `events.jsonl.<timestamp>`, oldest
  pruned). Read this when you need to observe timing. The shared
  `latchkey gateway` subprocess's output is routed through the same log
  (each line at `DEBUG`, prefixed with `[latchkey gateway]`), so it is
  timestamped and rotated too rather than living in a separate unrotated
  file.

- `latchkey_forward.log` -- the raw stdout/stderr capture of the detached
  supervisor process. Its file descriptor is handed straight to the
  process, so it cannot be rotated mid-write; instead the supervisor is
  spawned with `--quiet`, so in steady state it logs nothing here (all
  logging goes to `events.jsonl`). This file therefore stays effectively
  empty and only ever captures rare startup-failure output (Click errors
  or a pre-logging traceback) that never reaches the structured log -- so
  it is the place to look if the supervisor dies before it starts logging.

  Each spawn appends a `<timestamp> === spawning ... ===` marker before
  handing the descriptor over. The child's own lines cannot be stamped
  from the parent (it writes to the descriptor directly), so the marker is
  what dates whatever follows it, letting a traceback here be lined up
  against the timestamped logs uploaded alongside it. Spawn time is also
  the only moment the file can safely be rotated -- no child holds the
  descriptor yet -- so an oversized capture (one left by an older build,
  or by a child crash-looping before its logging is configured) is rotated
  there, once it passes 10MB, to `latchkey_forward.log.<timestamp>`, keeping
  only the newest rotation. Without that the file is append-only for the life
  of the install, and is gzipped and re-uploaded with every bug report.

## Error reporting (Sentry)

`mngr latchkey forward` can report errors to Sentry. It is **off by default** and
configured entirely via `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_*` environment variables (the
`MNGR_LATCHKEY_` prefix distinguishes `mngr latchkey` from the upstream core
`latchkey` project). The supervisor owns no Sentry project / environment
definitions: it receives concrete values as strings, which the embedder resolves
and passes in.

The **infrastructure** (which project, how the build is tagged) is snapshotted
into the daemon's environment when it is spawned:

- `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_DSN` -- the Sentry DSN to report to.
- `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` -- the Sentry environment label (e.g.
  `production`, `staging`, `development`).
- `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_RELEASE` / `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_GIT_SHA` -- the release
  version and git SHA events are tagged with.
- `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_S3_BUCKET` -- the S3 bucket to upload the supervisor's
  logs (`events.jsonl`, rotated copies, `latchkey_forward.log`) and a captured
  traceback to. Empty / unset means there is no bucket, so nothing is uploaded.

Sentry initializes whenever `DSN`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `RELEASE`, and `GIT_SHA` are all
present (run standalone without them, it simply does nothing). They are required
together: the supervisor has no fallback of its own.

The **consent** -- whether to send reports at all (log/traceback attachments ride
along with reports) -- is read live, not snapshotted, so the embedder can toggle
it on a running daemon without respawning it:

- `MNGR_LATCHKEY_SENTRY_CONSENT_FILE` -- path to a JSON file
  (`{"report_unexpected_errors": bool}`) that the embedder writes and rewrites
  whenever the user changes their consent. The daemon reads it on every event, so
  a grant/revoke takes effect immediately. An absent/unreadable file means
  reporting is off.

Events are tagged with the `mngr-latchkey-forward` service name so they are
distinguishable from other Imbue Python processes that report to the same
projects. When the minds desktop client spawns the supervisor it sets all of
these automatically -- resolving the DSN / environment / bucket from its own
Sentry settings and maintaining the consent file from the user's error-reporting
settings.

## Permissions config

The package owns the `latchkey_permissions.json` schema (a subset of
detent's rule format). Per-host edits go through the gateway's
bundled `permissions` extension (see [Gateway HTTP extensions](#gateway-http-extensions));
only the deny-all default, the admin file, and the per-agent opaque
baseline are written directly via `imbue.mngr_latchkey.store.save_permissions`.

### Per-account grants

Third-party service access is granted **per latchkey account**, not per
service. Latchkey (>= 3.2.0) tells detent which account's credentials it
injected into a request (as `customMetadata.account`; the unnamed default
account is the empty string), and detent (>= 1.11.0) can compose schemas, so
each grant is a rule keyed `<scope>:<account>` backed by a generated schema
that intersects the built-in scope with that account:

```json
{
  "rules": [{ "slack-api:hynek@imbue-ai": ["slack-read-all"] }],
  "schemas": {
    "slack-api:hynek@imbue-ai": {
      "allOf": [
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/slack-api" },
        {
          "properties": {
            "customMetadata": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": { "account": { "const": "hynek@imbue-ai" } },
              "required": ["account"]
            }
          },
          "required": ["customMetadata"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Detent stops at the first rule whose *scope* matches, and a request made with
another account does not match this one, so per-account rules simply stack.

The `<scope>:<account>` **name is only a naming convention** -- a stable,
human-readable identifier -- and is never parsed: both a detent scope name and
an account may legitimately contain a colon. Everything that needs to know what
a rule grants inspects the *schema structure* instead (the `$ref` to the base
scope next to the `customMetadata.account` gate).

The name is still required to be *unique* per (scope, account) pair, since the
gateway merges rules by key, so the scope half is percent-escaped (`%` -> `%25`,
then `:` -> `%3A`) before the two are joined. That makes the mapping injective
whatever either half contains -- and it is the identity for every scope name the
catalog ships, so keys read exactly as above. The account is the last field and
is never escaped.
`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes` is the single owner of both sides of that
structure: `build_account_grant` composes a grant (key + permissions + backing
schema) and `list_account_grants` / `resolve_account_scope` /
`resolved_schema_names` read grants back.
`ServicesCatalog.list_service_account_grants` layers the catalog on top, which
is what every consumer (the minds connectors page, the permission dialog's
pre-check, the revoke paths, and VPS credential sync) actually calls. The
gateway's `permission_requests` extension carries a JavaScript copy of the two
*generating* helpers (it computes a pending request's effect in-process), guarded
against drift by `account_scopes_test.py`; nothing on the JavaScript side reads
grants back.

Minds' own gateway-self scopes (`latchkey-self`, `minds-api-proxy-*`) stay
account-agnostic: latchkey attaches no account metadata to requests an
extension serves, so an account-gated schema would never match them.

## Data-format migrations

The plugin records the version of its on-disk data format in a
`data-format-version` file at the root of `<latchkey_directory>/mngr_latchkey/`.
When the shape of that state changes incompatibly, the change is expressed as a
reversible migration (`up`/`down`) under the `imbue.mngr_latchkey.migrations`
package rather than as ad-hoc repair code in the readers. Every
`Latchkey.initialize()` reconciles the recorded version against the version the
installed code targets, applying the intervening migrations in the appropriate
direction (`up` after an upgrade, `down` after a downgrade) and re-stamping the
file. This is cheap in the steady state (one small file read when already
current), and a fresh install is simply stamped straight to the current version.

Besides the plugin's own data directory, every migration step is handed the
latchkey directory and binary, because rewriting the plugin's state sometimes
requires looking at the *upstream* latchkey state next to it -- the per-account
permissions migration, for instance, shells out to `latchkey auth list
--offline` to learn which accounts have stored credentials. It does so only once
it has found a host file to rewrite, so a startup with nothing to migrate never
pays for it, and a failed listing aborts the migration rather than being read as
"no accounts anywhere". A per-host permissions file that cannot be read, parsed,
or rewritten is replaced with the file a freshly-created host would get (the
agent baseline) rather than failing the whole run: the host keeps working from a
clean slate and its agents can re-request what they need.

# Reference

The sections below are deeper detail for power users, front-end authors,
and embedders. Most callers only need the CLI above.

## Gateway HTTP extensions

`mngr latchkey forward` drops three `.mjs` extensions into
`<latchkey-directory>/extensions/`. All expose plain HTTP endpoints
on the gateway's listen port and authenticate the caller via two
headers:

* `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password: <password>` -- the gateway listen
  password from `mngr latchkey gateway-info`.
* `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override: <jwt>` -- a JWT minted
  for the permissions file you want the gateway to evaluate the
  request against. For full access to both extensions, use the JWT
  from `mngr latchkey admin-jwt`.

A shell client would typically wire these up once:

```sh
ADMIN_JWT=$(mngr latchkey admin-jwt)
eval "$(mngr latchkey gateway-info | jq -r '@text "GATEWAY_URL=\(.url); GATEWAY_PASSWORD=\(.password)"')"
auth=(-H "X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password: $GATEWAY_PASSWORD" -H "X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override: $ADMIN_JWT")
```

### `permission-requests` extension

A pending-permission queue. Agents submit a request when they hit a
blocked service; UIs (the minds desktop client, your own front-end)
consume the stream and approve/delete on resolution.

* `POST /permission-requests` with body
  `{"agent_id": "...", "rationale": "...", "type": "...", "payload": {...}}`.
  Two `type` values are accepted:
  * `"predefined"` -- detent scope/permission grant for one signed-in
    account of the service, with payload
    `{"scope": "...", "permissions": ["...", ...], "account": "..."}`.
    The scope must be one named in the bundled `services.json` catalog,
    and each permission must be either one the catalog lists for that
    scope or the catch-all `any`. `account` is the latchkey account the
    grant applies to (the unnamed default account is the empty string);
    it is optional, and an agent that does not know which account to use
    omits it. A request with no account has an **empty** `effect` -- it
    can only be resolved by a client that names the chosen account in the
    approve override body (see below), which is what the minds dialog
    does after the user picks or signs one in.
  * `"file-sharing"` -- single-file access through the `minds-api-proxy`
    extension, with payload `{"path": "<absolute-path>"}`. The path
    must be absolute and free of `..` segments.

  The extension generates a `request_id` server-side, stores the
  caller-supplied fields plus the `target` permissions.json (taken
  from the extension context) and a precomputed `effect`
  (`{rules?, schemas?}`) that an approval would splice into
  `target`, and returns the full persisted record. Available to
  agents.
* `GET /permission-requests` returns the current queue as
  newline-delimited JSON. Each line carries the full persisted
  shape. Add `?follow=true` to keep the connection open and stream
  every newly-POSTed request as it arrives. Available to the admin.
* `POST /permission-requests/approve/<request_id>` approves the
  named request: the extension reads it, splices its `effect` into
  its `target` permissions.json (creating the file if missing,
  merging rules by scope key and schemas by name), then removes the
  pending request file. Returns `200` with `{request_id, target,
  applied}` where `applied` is the freshly-rewritten permissions
  file. Available to the admin.

  An optional JSON body overrides what the approval grants, recomputing
  the effect from the user's choices: `{"account": "...",
  "permissions": [...]}` for a `predefined` request (the permission list
  is optional), `{"path": "..."}` for `file-sharing`, and
  `{"permissions": [...], "target_workspace_id": ...}` for `workspace`.
* `DELETE /permission-requests/<request_id>` removes a single pending
  request without applying its effect. UIs call this on deny so a
  fresh `?follow=true` consumer never sees the resolved request
  again. Available to the admin.

Pending requests are stored as one JSON file per request under
`<latchkey-directory>/permission_requests/v3/`. The `v3` segment is
the on-disk schema version; future shape changes get a new directory
rather than trying to migrate files in place (`v3` introduced the
per-account `predefined` payload).

### `minds-api-proxy` extension

Transparent HTTP reverse proxy from the gateway to an embedder-supplied
"Minds API" base URL.

* `ANY /minds-api-proxy` forwards to `<minds-api>/`.
* `ANY /minds-api-proxy/<rest>...` forwards to
  `<minds-api>/<rest>...`, preserving the inbound method, query
  string, headers (minus hop-by-hop entries and the gateway-internal
  password / permissions-override headers), and body. The upstream
  response status, headers, and body stream straight back.

The upstream base URL is read from the
`LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_URL` env var on every request. If the
var is unset/empty/unparseable the proxy responds 503 with a JSON
error body. There is no in-process cache to invalidate: an embedder
that needs to repoint the proxy at a new upstream simply respawns
the gateway (or the `mngr latchkey forward` supervisor that owns it)
with a fresh value for the env var.

The proxy authenticates *to* the upstream Minds API on behalf of the
agent. When `LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_KEY` is set, the proxy
overwrites the inbound `Authorization` header with
`Bearer <LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_KEY>` before forwarding. Agents
therefore never see the key, and an agent that tries to spoof an
`Authorization` header has its value dropped on the floor. When the
env var is unset, the inbound `Authorization` value is forwarded
unchanged (useful for tests / local fixtures that do not bother
stubbing the key; the upstream will simply 401 the request).

Other than the `Authorization` overwrite, the extension performs no
authentication of its own beyond the gateway's normal permission
check (against the synthetic `latchkey-self.invalid` URL). Restricting
which paths an agent can reach through the proxy is therefore a job
for the agent's `latchkey_permissions.json`.

### `permissions` extension

Reads and edits a detent permissions file at a caller-supplied path.
The gateway is launched with the environment variable
`LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_PERMISSIONS_ROOT` pointing at this package's data
directory; any `path` query parameter that resolves outside that
root is rejected with HTTP 403.

* `GET /permissions?path=<file>` returns the full permissions file.
* `GET /permissions/available` returns the full permission catalog as
  a JSON object keyed by raw service name. Each value is an array of
  scope entries (a single service may expose more than one scope), each
  with the shape `{"scope": "<schema_name>", "display_name": "...",
  "description": "...", "permissions": [{"name": "<schema_name>",
  "description": "..."}, ...]}`. The scope-level `description` and each
  permission's `description` carry detent's per-schema `$comment`
  summaries (both optional).
* `GET /permissions/available/<service_name>` returns the permission
  catalog entries for `<service_name>` (e.g. `slack`, `google-gmail`)
  as an array, using the same value shape, or 404 if the service is
  unknown. The catch-all `any` permission is always injected at index 0
  of every scope's `permissions` array, so a caller can always
  request unrestricted access under a known scope. This endpoint
  is backed by a `services.json` file (keyed by raw service name)
  that ships alongside the extension; the path query parameter
  is not consulted.
* `GET /permissions/rules?path=<file>&rule_key=<scope>` returns the
  rule for `<scope>`, or 404 if absent.
* `POST /permissions/rules?path=<file>&rule_key=<key>` with the body
  `{"permissions": ["slack-read-all", ...], "schemas": {"<name>": {...}}}`
  adds or replaces the rule for `<key>`. `schemas` is optional and is
  merged by name into the file's `schemas` object; everything else in
  the file is preserved verbatim. The target file (and any missing
  parent directories, e.g. `hosts/<host_id>/`) is created if it does
  not yet exist.

  The extension never synthesizes schemas and never interprets
  `<key>`, so a caller whose key is not a name detent already knows (a
  built-in schema, or one already defined in the file) **must** define
  it here. That is how per-account grants are written: their key names a
  generated schema composed by
  `imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes.build_account_grant`, which owns
  that shape (see [Per-account grants](#per-account-grants)).
* `DELETE /permissions/rules?path=<file>&rule_key=<scope>` removes
  the named rule.

The `services.json` catalog is generated from detent's built-in request
schemas; do not edit it by hand. Regenerate it against a detent checkout
with:

```sh
uv run python libs/mngr_latchkey/scripts/generate_services_json.py \
  --detent-root /path/to/detent
```

Display names and the service ordering are editorial metadata detent does
not carry; they live as curated constants in that script.

`services.json` also carries minds' own *additional* (custom) services --
ones detent has no schemas for, currently `claude.ai`. Their definitions are
hand-maintained in `imbue/mngr_latchkey/additional_services.json` (a
`display_name`, a `base_api_url`, the single Detent `scope` it exposes with
an inline scope `schema`, and its grantable `permissions`, each with an
inline `schema`), and the generator *folds their catalog entries into*
`services.json`. That way every reader of the catalog -- `ServicesCatalog`
and both gateway extensions -- works from one file in one shape and never
has to know which of the two sources a service came from.

Because a custom scope is not a detent builtin, its schemas have to reach the
gateway's permission check. Rather than inlining them into every host file,
`core.Latchkey.initialize()` materializes them **once** into a shared
`minds_shared_schemas.json` (a schemas-only detent config, see
`SHARED_SCHEMAS_FILENAME`), and every per-host permissions file references it
via detent's `include` directive (added by the agent baseline and, for
pre-existing files, a data-format migration). The include is a *bare relative*
name so it resolves next to the referencing file on both the desktop (the
opaque-handle directory) and a VPS (`~/.latchkey`, where `remote_gateway`
ships the shared file alongside the permissions file). Granting a custom scope
is then a plain rule write -- no per-host schema inlining.

`imbue.mngr_latchkey.additional_services` is the single Python chokepoint for
the file. It exposes the registration list (each service is registered with the
`latchkey` CLI at gateway bring-up), the merged schemas used to materialize the
shared file, and the catalog projection the generator folds into
`services.json`. No gateway extension reads it -- they only read
`services.json`.

A typical end-to-end shell flow:

```sh
# Stream pending requests as they come in.
curl -N "${auth[@]}" "$GATEWAY_URL/permission-requests?follow=true"

# Grant the agent slack-read-all for one Slack account on its host's
# permissions file. Grants are per account, so the rule names a generated
# schema that gates the built-in slack-api scope on that account -- and the
# caller, not the gateway, defines it.
HOST_PERMS=$MNGR_LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY/mngr_latchkey/hosts/$HOST_ID/latchkey_permissions.json
RULE_KEY='slack-api:hynek@imbue-ai'
curl -X POST "${auth[@]}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"permissions": ["slack-read-all"],
       "schemas": {"slack-api:hynek@imbue-ai": {"allOf": [
         {"$ref": "#/$defs/slack-api"},
         {"properties": {"customMetadata": {"type": "object",
            "properties": {"account": {"const": "hynek@imbue-ai"}},
            "required": ["account"]}},
          "required": ["customMetadata"]}]}}}' \
  "$GATEWAY_URL/permissions/rules?path=$HOST_PERMS&rule_key=$RULE_KEY"

# Clear the pending request now that it has been resolved.
curl -X DELETE "${auth[@]}" "$GATEWAY_URL/permission-requests/$REQUEST_ID"
```

## Embedding

Embedders (such as the minds desktop client) typically want a single
detached ``mngr latchkey forward`` supervisor that survives embedder
restarts and adopts the existing one instead of double-spawning. The
:class:`LatchkeyForwardSupervisor` does exactly that:

```python
from imbue.mngr_latchkey.forward_supervisor import LatchkeyForwardSupervisor

supervisor = LatchkeyForwardSupervisor(
    mngr_binary="/path/to/mngr",          # default: ``mngr`` on PATH
    latchkey_binary="/path/to/latchkey",  # default: ``latchkey`` on PATH
    latchkey_directory=root_dir,
)
supervisor.ensure_running()  # idempotent; spawns or adopts as needed
# ... do whatever the embedder does ...
# Optional: ``supervisor.stop()`` to terminate the detached process and
# tear down the gateway. Omitting this leaves the supervisor running
# detached, which is what minds does so the gateway survives a
# desktop-client restart.
```

## Python API

Every CLI subcommand is a thin wrapper around the library; the library
remains importable for embedders such as the minds desktop client.

```python
from imbue.mngr_latchkey.core import Latchkey
from imbue.mngr_latchkey.agent_setup import (
    prepare_agent_latchkey,
    finalize_host_permissions,
)
from imbue.mngr_latchkey.discovery import (
    LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler,
    LatchkeyDestructionHandler,
)
from imbue.mngr_forward.ssh_tunnel import SSHTunnelManager

latchkey = Latchkey(
    latchkey_binary="/path/to/latchkey",  # default: "latchkey" on PATH
    latchkey_directory=root_dir,
)
latchkey.initialize()

# (a) Pre-create env vars + opaque permissions handle for a new host.
setup = prepare_agent_latchkey(latchkey, is_tunneled=True)
# setup.env: LATCHKEY_GATEWAY[_SECONDARY,_PASSWORD,_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE,_DISABLE_COUNTING]
#   LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_SECONDARY (tunneled mode only) is the agent's URL for the
#   per-VPS gateway: http://127.0.0.1:<INNER_PORT>
# setup.opaque_permissions_path: pass to finalize_host_permissions later

# ... mngr create returns the canonical host id ...

# (b) Point the opaque handle at the canonical host permissions path.
finalize_host_permissions(latchkey, setup.opaque_permissions_path, host_id)
# Raises LatchkeyStoreError on failure -- callers decide whether to abort
# or just surface a warning.

# (c) Plug the discovery and destruction handlers into your agent
# discovery stream so reverse tunnels are opened on discovery and
# closed on destruction.
tunnel_manager = SSHTunnelManager()
tunnel_manager.start_reverse_tunnel_health_check()
on_discovered = LatchkeyDiscoveryHandler(
    latchkey=latchkey, tunnel_manager=tunnel_manager, concurrency_group=cg
)
on_destroyed = LatchkeyDestructionHandler(tunnel_manager=tunnel_manager)
```

The `latchkey_directory` is used both as the upstream `LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY`
for spawned `latchkey` subprocesses and as the root of this package's own
metadata subdirectory (`<latchkey_directory>/mngr_latchkey/`, accessible
via `Latchkey.plugin_data_dir`).
