"""Pytest fixtures and session-finish leak detection for mngr_aws tests.

Modeled after ``libs/mngr_modal/imbue/mngr_modal/conftest.py``. Provides
the same three-layer safety net for AWS release tests so killed test
runs cannot leak EC2 cost:

1. Per-test cleanup happens via ``mngr destroy --force`` in each test's
   ``finally`` block (in ``test_release_aws.py``).
2. ``pytest_sessionfinish`` here scans for leaked EC2 instances tagged
   ``mngr-pytest-launched=true`` at the end of the session, force-
   terminates any matches older than the TTL, and fails the session.
3. Cloud-init in each test instance runs ``shutdown -P +N``. With the
   release default ``terminate_on_shutdown = true``
   (``InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior=terminate``) this self-terminates
   the instance even if pytest itself is killed; the resumable-idle-stop
   test overrides the flag to ``false`` (the cap stops, not terminates,
   the instance) and leans on layer 2 to reap any leak.

Layer 2 relies solely on a tag scan because the current release-test
path spawns ``mngr create`` in a subprocess, so there is no Python
hand-off back to the test process where an in-process tracking list
would live. ``AwsVpsClient.create_instance`` adds the
``mngr-pytest-launched=true`` tag (see ``AWS_PYTEST_LAUNCHED_TAG``)
to every EC2 instance launched while ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` is set,
and the scan filters on that tag and ignores anything younger than
``_TEST_LEAK_TTL`` so it never race-kills an in-flight test on a
parallel worker.

Also registers the shared plugin-test fixtures (including
``temp_mngr_ctx``) so backend-level unit tests can construct real
provider instances; mirrors the conftest pattern used by
``mngr_vps`` and ``mngr_schedule``.
