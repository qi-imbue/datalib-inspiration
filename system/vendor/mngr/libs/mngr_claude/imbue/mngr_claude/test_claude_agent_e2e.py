"""Release test: full end-to-end lifecycle of a real mngr-managed claude agent.

Drives the real ``mngr`` CLI against the real ``claude`` binary and a real model
through the shared agent release lifecycle (create -> WAITING -> message -> RUNNING
-> transcript -> stop/start resume -> destroy -> adopt-from-preserved -> recall). The
arc and assertions live in ``imbue.mngr.agents.agent_release_testing``; this file
supplies claude's plumbing via an :class:`AgentReleaseProfile`.

claude runs the same shared arc as every other port: it observes the RUNNING marker (its
UserPromptSubmit hook touches the ``active`` marker), forces a bash tool call, and -- with
``asserts_usage`` on -- reports token usage. Its plumbing differs from the sibling ports
only in:

* Repo-local ``.gitignore``. claude's preflight refuses to write hooks to
  ``.claude/settings.local.json`` unless the repository's *own* ``.gitignore``
  excludes it (a global rule is rejected, since remote hosts lack it).
  ``_init_claude_workspace`` seeds that rule for both the seed worktree and the fresh
  adoption worktree; the sibling ports don't need this.

* Custom-API-key approval. The plugin's ``approve_api_key_for_claude`` pre-approves the
  passed-in ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` during provision, so claude doesn't block on its
  custom-key dialog (no sibling port has one). claude's other first-run dialogs
  (onboarding/effort) and work-dir trust are dismissed by the ``--yes`` the harness
  already passes for every agent -- not a claude specific -- so the test seeds no config.

* Post-``--`` args. ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` lets the forced bash tool call
  run without a permission pause, ``--pass-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` carries the key to the
  agent, and ``--model haiku`` pins the cheapest tier (the seed/recall turns don't need
  more).

* Adoption resolves by the preserved session JSONL's absolute path. claude has no
  root-session-id sidecar file (unlike codex); the preserved native store is the
  per-agent ``projects/<encoded-work-dir>/<session-id>.jsonl`` tree, and
  ``_resolve_adopt_session`` accepts a ``.jsonl`` path directly, so the path is both
  unambiguous and independent of the encoded-cwd subdir name.

Requires ``claude`` on PATH and ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` in the environment; skipped
otherwise. Release-marked, so it does not run in CI.
