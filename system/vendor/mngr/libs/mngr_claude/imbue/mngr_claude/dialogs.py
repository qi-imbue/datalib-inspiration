"""Claude Code TUI dialogs, for 2.1.269.

A SNAPSHOT OF ONE BINARY. Every pattern and option label below was read out of the
shipped claude 2.1.269 executable. On a version bump, rewrite this file against the
new binary and change ``CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`` -- do not annotate what moved, do not
keep patterns "for compatibility". ``test_patterns_match_installed_binary`` asserts every
pattern here still matches the installed claude, and that check is only meaningful if
nothing in the file is historical.

Three kinds of surface, told apart by what answering one costs:

  BENIGN, RECOGNISED       Esc dismisses it and the conversation is untouched. Always
                           handled, never surfaced, never named in config -- there is no
                           decision to delegate.
  NON-BENIGN, RECOGNISED   A confirmation holding the input, where a wrong answer changes
                           something. Answered only if the operator opted in
                           (``sensibly_deal_with_dialogs``), and only ever on the option
                           this module names for it.
  UNRECOGNISED             Something owns the input and we cannot name it, so we cannot
                           know whether answering it is benign. Raised.

"Benign" is the axis that decides all of this. It is not about how a surface looks: the
model-switch confirmation and the theme picker are both selectors, and one of them changes
the session. It is about whether mngr dealing with the surface itself can be regretted.

The pane predicates below (shell mode, the input prompt) came from PR #397 and are
moved here unchanged so one module owns "how to read a claude screen".

    it.

    a guess and is meant to read as one. Two things bound it, because the surface is unknown
    and the cost of a wrong press is not:

    * The digit is only sent to a pane showing a numbered selector. Without that check a "1"
      would be typed as text into whatever holds the input -- and the caller loops, so it would
      be typed repeatedly. This is the same guard that stopped the usage-limit caption from
      being walked as if it were its own option list.
    * Pressing is not succeeding. ``deal_with_dialogs`` re-classifies afterwards, refuses the
      send if the pane did not change, and gives up after its pass budget. So "1" that answers
      nothing still ends in the refusal this class started as.
