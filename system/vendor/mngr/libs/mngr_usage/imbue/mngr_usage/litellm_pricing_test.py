"""Pin mngr_usage's pricing to litellm (the ultimate source), for every provider.

Both the OpenAI and the Anthropic entries are checked directly against litellm's
``model_prices_and_context_window`` map -- editing a price here without matching
litellm fails this test. Anthropic used to be pinned instead to
apps/modal_litellm's inline table, but the proxy no longer carries one: it routes
every Anthropic model through a single catch-all entry and takes pricing from
this same litellm map, so that mirror (and its drift test) is gone and litellm is
the one source both sides answer to. Skipped only if litellm isn't importable (it
is in the monorepo workspace, which is where this runs in CI).
