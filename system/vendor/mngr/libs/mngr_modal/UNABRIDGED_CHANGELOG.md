# Unabridged Changelog - mngr_modal

Full, unedited changelog entries consolidated nightly from individual files in `libs/mngr_modal/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-07-14

Agent listings from this provider now populate `AgentDetails.pid` (the agent's main process PID in the remote host's PID namespace), extracted from the same already-collected tmux/ps probe data.

Test-only: mark the Modal snapshot acceptance test (`test_snapshot_create_then_list_on_modal`) as known-flaky. It sporadically fails while waiting for sshd on a freshly-booted Modal host ("Error reading SSH protocol banner"), which is Modal-side boot timing rather than a defect in the snapshot code.

## 2026-07-08

`discover_hosts_and_agents` now reads a **running** host's agents **live** off the sandbox instead of only from the state volume. Agents created *inside* the sandbox (for example the user's workspace agent) are never written to the outer state volume -- only host-side agents like `system-services` are -- so resolving from the volume alone left `mngr destroy` / `mngr start` unable to find a live in-sandbox agent (`Agent not found`), and minds' teardown spun on "Destroying..." forever. Offline hosts still resolve from the volume, and if the live read fails the host falls back to the volume so it still lists. This mirrors the VPS (aws/vultr) providers, which already read running hosts live.

`stop_host` no longer silently swallows a failed `sandbox.terminate()`. A failed terminate means the Modal sandbox is still running (a billing orphan), so it now raises a `ModalMngrError`; `destroy_host` records it as a cleanup failure so `mngr destroy` reports failure (and exits non-zero) instead of falsely succeeding while the sandbox keeps running.

`start_host` now clears `stop_reason` on the persisted host record when it resumes a host from a snapshot. Previously a host that was resumed (from PAUSED/STOPPED) and then later hard-killed was mis-derived as PAUSED/STOPPED instead of CRASHED, so it was never garbage-collected and wrongly showed a Resume control. This mirrors the lima provider's behavior on restart.

`start_host` auto-restart (no explicit `snapshot_id`) selects the most recent snapshot. The "initial" snapshot is taken in `on_agent_created` (after the agent is created and its initial message delivered), so it carries the agent and is a valid restore point; a graceful stop/pause leaves a newer snapshot that is preferred. When the host has no snapshots at all it raises `NoSnapshotsModalMngrError` (recreate the workspace rather than restart).

## 2026-07-07

Added an `is_vm_runtime_enabled` setting to the Modal provider config that controls whether sandboxes run on Modal's VM runtime (https://modal.com/docs/guide/vm-sandboxes) instead of the default gVisor runtime. It defaults to false (gVisor); set `is_vm_runtime_enabled = true` under `[providers.modal]` to create sandboxes with `experimental_options = {"vm_runtime": True}`, which provides stronger isolation and broader syscall compatibility (e.g. Docker-in-sandbox state surviving a filesystem snapshot).

Modal streaming discovery now reports each running host's SSH endpoint (via the shared `collect_cached_host_ssh_infos` helper) so the discovery poller re-emits it as a `HOST_SSH_INFO` event. Previously only a full `mngr list` surfaced SSH info, so a consumer that tunnels to Modal hosts through the streaming discovery path (e.g. the minds system_interface forward) could be left unable to reach them.

## 2026-07-06

Updated the per-host-bounded discovery override to accept the new cross-poll read registry parameter (unused by this batch provider, which reads all hosts in one bounded pass). No behavioral change for this provider.

Updated the Modal provider for mngr's new per-provider discovery: it now implements the bounded `discover_hosts_and_agents_within_timeouts` discovery entry point. Because Modal reads all host and agent state from the state volume in one batched pass, individual host reads are not separately bounded -- the provider is still bounded by the provider-level discovery error timeout, and no host is marked UNKNOWN by this path.

Fixed a regression where Modal authentication failures during `mngr list` surfaced as a raw proxy auth error instead of the friendly Modal auth error (with the provider name and disable hint): the `discover_hosts_and_agents` batch path is decorated with the auth-error handler again.

## 2026-07-01

Added a new async/await ratchet (`test_prevent_async_await`) that freezes the current amount of `async def` / `await` usage in this project and fails if new async code is added. We strongly prefer synchronous code: it is far easier to debug, and our software is intentionally low-scale, so async provides no benefit. Existing usage is grandfathered in at its current count; the count can only decrease.

## 2026-06-26

Added scope docstrings to this package's release tests so the TMR (test
map-reduce) harness can anchor each test's intended scope on its docstring
rather than on a tutorial block. Docstring-only; no test logic changed.

## 2026-06-22

Report an unauthenticated Modal provider consistently with the other cloud providers.

A missing/invalid Modal token now raises the shared `ProviderNotAuthorizedError` from provider construction, and `ModalAuthError` is now a subclass of `ProviderNotAuthorizedError` (preserving its existing message and remediation). As a result, Modal auth failures are categorized the same way as the other cloud providers in `mngr list` -- one consistent error line and the granular provider-inaccessible exit code -- instead of an ad-hoc plugin error.

Fixed host lock reporting for Modal hosts: a host's lock status is now derived from a real flock held-probe rather than the lock file's presence. The lock file now persists after release, so the previous mtime-based check would have reported every previously-locked host as permanently locked.

## 2026-06-19

Fixed a dead relative link in the README so it resolves on the PyPI project page.

Added `test_provider_release_trip1` to the Modal release suite: a single-boot full-lifecycle trip (create, exec, plain stop, `--stop-host` refusal, start, persistence, snapshot, out-of-band kill, gc, backend-clean) built on the shared provider release harness. Modal cannot stop a host's compute, so the trip asserts `mngr stop --stop-host` is refused with `HostShutdownNotSupportedError`; it is not parametrized over isolation (Modal has no isolation modes). Gated on Modal credentials plus the new `MNGR_MODAL_RELEASE_TESTS=1` opt-in.

Also added `test_provider_release_trip3` (snapshot survives destroy): Modal snapshots are portable, so the trip snapshots a host, destroys it, then asserts a fresh `mngr create --snapshot` restores the captured filesystem.

Also added `test_provider_release_trip4` (error classification): a no-boot CLI trip asserting `mngr create` with unresolvable Modal credentials surfaces the right error. This PR also fixes Modal to raise the contract `ProviderUnavailableError` (it previously raised a plain `MngrError`), with curated help pointing at `uvx modal token set`; the trip asserts the contract error class + that help. The `--vps-*` migration-arg scenario is skipped (Modal has its own build-arg parser).

Also added `test_provider_release_trip2` (idle auto-shutdown contract): it caps the sandbox lifetime via `-b --timeout=120` and asserts the sandbox is terminated by Modal's own timeout. Modal has no resumable stopped state, so the trip asserts the termination only and skips the resume.

## 2026-06-18

Agent lifecycle detection now targets the agent's primary tmux window by name (the configurable `tmux.primary_window_name`, default `agent`) instead of the literal `:0` index, so it works regardless of the user's tmux `base-index` setting.

## 2026-06-16

`destroy_host` now raises a `CleanupFailedGroup` carrying the classified cleanup failures (instead of returning them, or swallowing errors as warnings) when a resource is left behind, and returns normally otherwise. A resource that was already gone is treated as benign (no failure); a resource that exists but could not be destroyed is recorded as a `HOST_RESOURCE_REMAINS` failure (or `OTHER` for a bookkeeping/record write failure), so `mngr destroy`/`cleanup` can surface it and exit with an informative, cause-specific code. See `specs/cleanup-error-aggregation.md`.

## 2026-06-12

## AWS provider support: ProviderBackendInterface refactor

`is_for_host_creation` was removed from `ProviderBackendInterface` (Modal-specific flag was being `del`'d in every other backend). Modal now overrides a default-no-op `bootstrap_for_host_creation(name, config, mngr_ctx)` method on the interface, where the per-user environment registration moves. `mngr create` invokes this hook before `build_provider_instance`. No behavior change for Modal.

## 2026-06-09

Offline hosts produced by this provider are now readable: the offline-host
construction path (used by both `get_host` for stopped hosts and
`to_offline_host`) returns an `OfflineHostWithVolume` (which implements the new
`HostFileReadInterface`) via the shared `make_readable_offline_host` helper.
This makes a stopped host's files readable through the same interface as an
online host -- used by Claude session preservation when a host is destroyed
while offline (the destroy path obtains the host via `get_host`), and available
to other readers of offline host data. The host's volume is resolved lazily on
first read, so this adds no per-host probe to host discovery. When no volume is
available, reads behave as "nothing there".

The new `get_volume_reference_for_host` is wrapped so missing/expired Modal
credentials surface as the user-friendly `ModalAuthError` (consistent with the
other provider methods) rather than a raw proxy error, including when reached
during offline-host construction.

## Remove Modal async-permission-propagation workaround

Modal has fixed the bug on their side where a just-created environment returned
`modal.exception.PermissionDeniedError` for several seconds (async per-user
permission propagation) before the creating user could operate on it.
Read-after-write is now immediate, so the workaround is no longer needed.

Removed from `mngr_modal`:

- The `ModalProxyPermissionDeniedError` retries in
  `_lookup_persistent_app_with_retry` and `_enter_ephemeral_app_context_with_retry`
  (`imbue.mngr_modal.backend`); both decorators once again retry only on
  `ModalProxyNotFoundError`.
- The `_invoke_modal_sdk_delete_with_retry` test-cleanup helper in `conftest.py`;
  `_classify_modal_sdk_delete` now invokes the SDK delete callable directly again.

## 2026-06-08

Standardized mngr_modal's project conftest on `register_plugin_test_fixtures(globals())`
for HOME isolation, the same single mechanism used by every mngr plugin. The
Modal-specific fixtures (including the credential-loading `setup_test_mngr_env`
override) are unchanged. Internal test-infrastructure change only; no user-facing
behavior change.

Creating a Modal host with an invalid argument (e.g. a non-existent
`--snapshot` image id) now fails with a clean single-line error
(`Error: Failed to create Modal host: '<id>' is not a valid Image ID.`) instead
of dumping a raw Python traceback. `create_host` now wraps
`ModalProxyInvalidError` in a user-facing `MngrError`, mirroring how
`ModalProxyRemoteError` was already handled.

## 2026-06-04

Added an acceptance test (`test_upload_deploy_files_handles_large_set_on_modal`) that uploads a large (600-file) deploy set to a real Modal host and verifies every file lands. This is the regression guard for github issue 1825, where `mngr create` on Modal failed during provisioning (`Error reading SSH protocol banner`) because deploy files were uploaded one SFTP channel at a time; the fix transfers them with a single rsync.

Updated references to the renamed `modal_proxy` test doubles: `TestingModalInterface`
is now `FakeModalInterface` (and the rest of the `Testing*` Modal family is now
`Fake*`). Affects the `make_testing_provider`/`testing_modal` test helpers and
fixtures, which now reference `FakeModalInterface`. No behavior change.

## 2026-06-04

- Three modal acceptance tests (`test_get_host_by_id`, `test_discover_hosts_includes_created_host`, `test_destroy_host_stops_sandbox_and_delete_host_removes_record`) had their `pytest.mark.timeout` bumped from 180s to 300s and a `pytest.mark.flaky` mark added. They all hit `sandbox.tunnels()` while waiting for SSH on a fresh Modal sandbox, which intermittently brushes the 180s ceiling under load -- the bump matches the longer-running peers in the same file (e.g. `test_persistent_host_creates_shutdown_script` already used 300s) and `flaky` lets offload retry on the rare residual timeout.

## 2026-06-02

Preserved connection-error handling in the Modal provider's optimized listing now that
`HostConnectionError` is a `MngrError` subclass. `get_host_and_agent_details` now re-raises
`HostConnectionError` from the inner SSH-collection guard so it still reaches the outer
handler that clears the per-host connection cache and falls back to the default listing,
instead of being swallowed by the inner `except MngrError`.

## 2026-06-01

Fixed flakiness in two `mngr_modal` host-volume acceptance tests by polling `get_volume_for_host` with `wait_for` instead of asserting once, to absorb the brief Modal control-plane lag before a freshly-created volume becomes resolvable by name.

# Offline agent field generators

Updated the provider's `get_host_and_agent_details` override to accept and forward the new `offline_field_generators` parameter to the base implementation, so offline plugin fields (see the mngr changelog entry) are populated when a host falls back to offline data.

## 2026-05-28

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-27

# Ratchet count tightening

- Tightened the violation counts recorded in `test_ratchets.py` to their current exact values (via `uv run pytest --inline-snapshot=trim`), locking in previously-unrecorded reductions. No source-code or behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Adopted the `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (added in `imbue_common`) via
`rc.check_bare_tmux_targets(_DIR, snapshot(0))` in this project's `test_ratchets.py`.
This ratchet prevents new occurrences of `tmux <subcmd> -t '<bare-name>'` -- targets
without a leading `=` exact-match prefix, which can silently route commands to a
sibling session whose name shares a prefix with the intended one. No production code
changes in this project; the adopting test starts at a baseline of zero violations.

## 2026-05-21

Fix the intro in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` so it references the correct entries directory. The path was `changelog/<project>/` (which never existed); the actual layout is `<project_dir>/changelog/`.

The acceptance test for `mngr_claude_usage`'s statusline-shim provisioning on a real Modal host (`test_provision_statusline_shim_on_modal_host`) is updated to assert against the new host-stable shim path layout (`<host_dir>/commands/claude_statusline.sh`) and the per-agent sidecar (`<state_dir>/commands/user_statusline_cmd`).

## 2026-05-20

## Modal provider no longer auto-creates an environment from non-create commands

`mngr list`, `mngr gc`, and other read flows no longer silently bootstrap a
Modal environment (the `Created Modal environment: ...` log line) just because
the modal provider is enabled. The Modal provider now disables itself (raises
`ProviderUnavailableError`, which higher-level loaders skip) when its per-user
Modal environment doesn't exist yet. Only `mngr create` is allowed to bootstrap
the environment on first use.

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

- `mngr_modal`: Modal backend now raises a new `ProviderEmptyError`
  (distinct from `ProviderUnavailableError`) when its per-user
  environment doesn't exist yet, so `mngr list` can silently skip the
  empty provider instead of aborting. (Counterpart to the new
  `ProviderEmptyError` handling in the listing pipeline.)

Collapse Modal environments across an offload-acceptance / offload-release
run to a single shared env (opt-in via `MNGR_TEST_SHARED_MODAL_ENV_NAME`).
Each fanned-out sandbox used to mint its own Modal environment and delete
it on teardown -- dozens to hundreds per run, driving the
1500-env-per-workspace cap into transient failures. Inside each sandbox,
the modal test fixtures (`real_modal_provider`, `persistent_modal_provider`,
`initial_snapshot_provider`, plus the session-scoped subprocess-env
fixtures) honor the env var: they thread its name through
`MngrConfig.prefix` + `ModalProviderConfig.user_id` so every test lands
in the shared env, and they skip env creation / deletion / leak-tracking
at the fixture layer (apps and volumes are still created and deleted
per-test as before). Local pytest behavior (no env var set) is unchanged.

Fix Modal resource leaks in `test_snapshot_and_shutdown.py`. The teardown's `modal app stop` and `modal volume delete` calls were both silently failing (`check=False`, captured output discarded); the fixture also wasn't passing an `environment_name` to `deploy_function`, so the test app + volume landed in the default `main` env outside any cleanup safety net. Pass the session-scoped Modal env to deploy, sandbox lookup, volume operations, and cleanup; run app-stop and volume-delete in parallel with `check=True` so any future failure surfaces immediately.

## Retry on async Modal permission propagation

Modal recently migrated their permission system so the per-user permission entry for a just-created environment is propagated asynchronously (typically ~3-7 seconds after `modal environment create` returns success). During that window, operations on the new environment raise `modal.exception.PermissionDeniedError` instead of `NotFoundError`. This was breaking every Modal acceptance test at fixture construction time.

- `imbue.mngr_modal.backend`: both `_enter_ephemeral_app_context_with_retry` and `_lookup_persistent_app_with_retry` now retry on `ModalProxyPermissionDeniedError` in addition to `ModalProxyNotFoundError`, matching the existing 5-attempt exponential backoff (1s→10s) used for env-not-found.
- `libs/mngr_modal/imbue/mngr_modal/conftest.py`: the test cleanup helper `_classify_modal_sdk_delete` now retries Modal SDK deletes through the same propagation window so that fast-running test teardowns don't spuriously leak environments/volumes.

No user-visible behavior change beyond fewer transient Modal failures and a small added startup latency (~3-7s on the very first `mngr create` against a brand-new environment, only on first use per profile).

Applied `@fixture_uses_resources` to `deployed_snapshot_function` in `test_snapshot_and_shutdown.py` to fix `test_snapshot_and_shutdown_missing_host_id` and `test_snapshot_and_shutdown_missing_sandbox_id` failing on the modal resource guard.

Bumped pinned `modal` dependency from 1.3.1 to 1.4.3 to stay in sync with the rest of the monorepo.

## 2026-05-14

CI acceptance test speedup — fix the `mngr_modal` session-end leak detector in `libs/mngr_modal/imbue/mngr_modal/conftest.py` (previously the `modal_session_cleanup` autouse fixture; now a `pytest_sessionfinish` hook so it runs after all session-scoped fixture teardowns -- pytest's autouse session-scoped fixtures tear down before non-autouse session-scoped fixtures regardless of declared dependencies, which made the previous fixture poll a still-registered env and fail before the deregister could run). The detector compared the global `modal environment list --json` against tests' tracked env names, but Modal's listing endpoints are eventually consistent w.r.t. deletion -- after a `modal environment delete X` returns "Environment 'X' not found", the env can still appear in the global list for tens of seconds. With one-test-per-batch the assertion almost never landed in the inconsistency window; with several tests per session it became consistent enough to repeatedly fail teardown on whichever test happened to be last. The fix is twofold: (a) the per-test and session-scope cleanup fixtures deregister tracked resources from `worker_modal_*_names` *only* when the cleanup chain confirmed the resource was deleted or already gone (the synchronous response is authoritative); cleanup failures keep the resource tracked and log a `logger.error` so the session-end leak detector still has a chance to surface a real leak. Cleanup return values are typed via a new `ModalCleanupOutcome` enum (`DELETED | NOT_FOUND | FAILED`). (b) the `pytest_sessionfinish` hook runs after all session-scoped fixture teardowns, so any name still in `worker_modal_*_names` at that point corresponds to a resource whose cleanup either FAILED or was never attempted (test crashed mid-fixture) -- i.e. a real leak rather than a listing-staleness false positive.

## 2026-05-12

TMR: when launching modal agents, override the modal provider config to
skip the per-agent "initial" filesystem snapshot. That snapshot adds 60-90s
per agent and runs once per agent (so 4 agents on a pooled host trigger
four snapshots), even though TMR's pooled hosts are ephemeral and the
snapshotter's host is snapshotted explicitly already.

## 2026-05-08

- mngr_modal: drop `ModalMode.TESTING` from production code paths; tests inject `TestingModalInterface` via `make_testing_provider` instead. Production `mngr_modal.backend` no longer imports `modal_proxy.testing` at module top, so the standard `**/testing.py` wheel-exclude rule applies cleanly to `modal_proxy` (no `only-include` workaround needed) and packaged consumers (e.g. minds.app) no longer crash with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imbue.modal_proxy.testing'`.
- mngr_modal: `ModalMode` retained with values `DIRECT` (default) and `PROXIED`. `PROXIED` is reserved for routing Modal traffic through the imbue_cloud gateway and currently raises `NotImplementedError` at `build_provider_instance`. The `mode` field on `ModalProviderConfig` is preserved.
- mngr_modal: extract pure `ModalProviderBackend._derive_modal_names(name, config, mngr_ctx)` helper so the environment-name / app-name / host-dir derivation can be unit-tested without instantiating any Modal interface.
- mngr_modal: drop unused `is_testing` parameter from `_get_or_create_app` (only ever non-default in the now-removed `TESTING` dispatch arm; the test-fixture path constructs `ModalProviderApp` directly and never went through this function).

- mngr_modal: extract `ModalProviderBackend._construct_modal_provider(name, config, mngr_ctx, modal_interface)` as the shared factory body. `build_provider_instance` matches the parent-class signature exactly, dispatches on `config.mode` (`DIRECT` selects `DirectModalInterface()`, `PROXIED` raises `NotImplementedError`), then delegates to `_construct_modal_provider`. Tests call `_construct_modal_provider` directly with `TestingModalInterface`. The factory has no per-implementation branches.
- mngr_modal: `make_testing_provider` collapses from a 35-line parallel constructor into a wrapper around `ModalProviderBackend._construct_modal_provider`.
- mngr_modal: delete the dead `mngr_modal/log_utils.py` re-export shim (`b66f3cbd5`'s in-tree migration is complete; nothing imports from it).

- mngr_modal: register the session-scoped Modal env created by `modal_subprocess_env` with the leak-detection registry (`register_modal_test_environment`) so that silent failures in the per-session cleanup helpers (`delete_modal_apps_in_environment` / `delete_modal_volumes_in_environment` / `delete_modal_environment`) are now caught by the autouse `modal_session_cleanup` at session end, rather than leaking the env onto the Modal account.

- mngr_modal: restore the per-test reset of `ModalProviderBackend._app_registry`. The
  autouse `_reset_modal_app_registry` fixture was deleted in #1533. After #1522
  reshaped the test factory to dispatch through `_construct_modal_provider`
  (which short-circuits on the class-level `_app_registry`), the reset became
  load-bearing for cross-test isolation: the second test in a worker would
  reuse the first test's cached app and skip `modal_interface.app_create(...)`,
  leaving `testing_modal._apps` empty and breaking helpers like
  `make_sandbox_with_tags`. Restoring the fixture fixes the post-merge CI
  failures on main.
