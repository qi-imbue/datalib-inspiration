# Unabridged Changelog - imbue_common

Full, unedited changelog entries consolidated nightly from individual files in `libs/imbue_common/changelog/`.

For a concise summary, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-07-21

Fixed a false positive in the `trailing comments` ratchet (`PREVENT_TRAILING_COMMENTS`): `#{...}` interpolation/format tokens (e.g. tmux format strings like `"#{client_width} #{client_height}"`) are no longer counted as trailing comments. The `#` in these tokens is interpolation syntax inside a string, not a comment. Real trailing comments, hex colors, and `PR #NNNN` references are unaffected.

## 2026-07-15

`LogAttachmentGroup` gained an optional `base_dir` field: a group with `base_dir` set sweeps that directory instead of the process's log folder, so error reports can attach log files that live outside it (e.g. minds attaching the detached `mngr latchkey forward` daemon's logs). A missing directory simply matches nothing.

Sentry error reports now carry a stable, randomly-generated anonymous user id (no PII) so Sentry can report the number of distinct installs affected by each issue. Added `get_or_create_anonymous_user_id` (persists a random id to a file, race-safe across processes) and a required `user_id` argument to `setup_sentry`, which is attached to every event via `sentry_sdk.set_user`. `send_default_pii` stays disabled; only this opaque id is sent.

Added `secret_wrapping`: pure envelope-encryption helpers (argon2id key derivation, AES-256-GCM DEK wrap/unwrap and secrets encrypt/decrypt) used by the minds workspace-sync feature. New dependencies: `argon2-cffi`, `cryptography`.

## 2026-07-14

Fixed the inline-function ratchet (`find_inline_functions`) double-counting a function nested two or more levels deep. It walked every `FunctionDef` in a file, including nested ones, and descended into all of each one's descendants, so a function with two enclosing functions was emitted once per ancestor. The recorded count therefore overstated the real number of inline functions. Nested defs are now collected keyed by source position and counted once. Only projects that actually nest functions two deep are affected; across the whole monorepo the sole recorded count that changes is `apps/minds` (from 9 to 7 before any code change).

## 2026-07-13

The trailing-comments ratchet (PREVENT_TRAILING_COMMENTS) no longer misfires on `PR #NNNN` references inside comment or docstring prose. The unanchored pattern treated the `#` of a PR number as a trailing comment (even on comment-only lines, since a match can start mid-line); a negative lookbehind now exempts a `#` immediately preceded by `PR `, alongside the existing hex-color and `ty: ignore` exemptions.

`setup_sentry` now accepts an `ignored_loggers` argument: glob patterns for stdlib logger names whose records must never become Sentry events or breadcrumbs. This is needed because Sentry's default logging integration patches `logging.Logger.callHandlers` at the class level, so it captures a logger's ERROR records as events even when that logger has `propagate=False`. Callers that already route a noisy third-party logger's output elsewhere (e.g. into loguru) can now pass those logger names so Sentry drops the raw records instead of flooding on already-handled noise.

## 2026-07-09

- Added: `LowerCaseStrEnum` in `imbue.imbue_common.enums` -- the lowercase sibling of `UpperCaseStrEnum`, for enums whose values are an externally visible, already-lowercase wire format (first used by the pool bake / destroy outcome statuses in `mngr_imbue_cloud`).

## 2026-07-06

Added a shared Sentry error-reporting library under `imbue.imbue_common.sentry`, so multiple Imbue Python processes can report errors without duplicating the machinery. It packages the generic pieces that previously lived in the minds backend: the loguru-to-Sentry event/breadcrumb handlers, the unsigned-S3 attachment uploader, the per-exception rate limiter, the oversized-event (HTTP 413) transport, the `before_send` chain (including the automatic-reporting consent gate and interrupt/clean-shutdown filtering), manual bug-report submission, and a parameterized `setup_sentry`.

The library is intentionally agnostic about *which* Sentry project/environment/bucket a process uses: `setup_sentry` takes a concrete `dsn`, `environment_name`, and optional `s3_attachment_bucket` (plus a `service_name`, the Sentry integrations, and a set of `LogAttachmentGroup`s describing which log files to attach). Project-specific config (the DSNs, the deploy-environment model, and the environment-to-bucket mapping) lives with each consuming project, not here. This pulls in `sentry-sdk`, `boto3`, and `traceback-with-variables` as dependencies of `imbue-common`.

## 2026-07-01

Added the shared `PREVENT_ASYNC_AWAIT` ratchet rule (in `common_ratchets.py`) and the `check_async_await` wrapper (in `standard_ratchet_checks.py`). This powers a new per-project `test_prevent_async_await` ratchet across the whole monorepo that freezes `async def` / `await` usage and prevents new async code from being added. We strongly prefer synchronous code: it is far easier to debug, and our software is intentionally low-scale, so async provides no benefit.

## 2026-06-26

`find_bash_scripts_without_strict_mode` (the helper behind the repo-wide bash strict-mode ratchet) now skips `*.sh` files under `.minds/template/`. Those are declarative secret-schema templates -- commented `export KEY=` files sourced by the deploy tooling (`scripts/push_vault_from_file.py`, `minds env deploy`) and copied per-tier, never executed standalone -- so `set -euo pipefail` is meaningless for them and they are not the class of runnable script the ratchet guards. This also removes a local-vs-CI count skew, since those templates were already absent from the offload build context.

## 2026-06-24

Updated the `PREVENT_HARDCODED_CLAUDE_DIR` ratchet's guidance text to reference
the renamed `find_user_config_in_isolated_mode()` accessor (was
`find_user_claude_config()`). No behavior change.

## 2026-06-19

Clarified the README's one-line description of the library's purpose.

## 2026-06-11

Fixed a bug in the `PREVENT_BUILTIN_EXCEPTION_RAISES` ratchet regex: a trailing `\b` after the opening paren meant it only matched raises whose first argument started with a word character (e.g. `raise OSError(msg)`), missing the common `raise ValueError("literal")` and `raise OSError()` forms. The ratchet now also excludes test files (consistent with tests legitimately raising built-in exceptions to simulate error conditions). Replaced the direct `ValueError` raises in the constrained `primitives` types and the `RegexPattern` validator with dedicated `InvalidPrimitiveValueError` / `InvalidRegexPatternError` exception types.

## 2026-06-10

Raised the stale coverage floor from 88% to 90% to match the coverage CI already measures (~95%), and removed the now-obsolete comment about per-package offload coverage drift (the offload bug that caused that drift has since been fixed, so coverage is deterministic).

## 2026-06-04

Ratchet file scans no longer crash on a tracked symlink that resolves to a directory. The file walker (`_get_all_files_with_extension`) now filters on `is_file()` instead of `exists()`, so a symlink-to-directory (which git lists as a blob but cannot be read as a file) is skipped instead of raising `FileReadError`.

- Refresh the stale test-type docstring in `conftest_hooks.py` that described acceptance tests as running "on all branches except release" and release tests as running "only on release". There is no `release` branch; acceptance tests run on every PR and release tests run via the dedicated Release Tests workflow (manual dispatch and `v*` tag pushes) and TMR. No behavior change.

Added a new common ratchet to the `ratchet_testing` framework: `check_per_file_host_upload` (AST-based `find_per_file_host_uploads_in_loops`) flags `write_file`/`write_text_file`/`put_file` calls inside `for`/`while` loops, steering bulk transfers toward a single rsync (`host.copy_directory`). Recurring per-file-over-SSH uploads have repeatedly caused upload timeouts and 'connection reset / SSH protocol banner' failures (see github issue 1825).

## 2026-06-02

A logging test that imported `BaseMngrError` from `imbue.mngr` (now removed) no longer reaches
into the `mngr` package: it uses a local test-only exception instead. No runtime behavior change.

## 2026-05-28

# Dropped redundant per-project ty/ruff ratchet tests

Removed this project's `test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors` from its
`test_ratchets.py`. ty resolves the uv workspace root and ruff (run from the repo
root) both scan across projects, so the per-project copies just re-ran the same
checks. The single repo-wide equivalents now live in `test_meta_ratchets.py`
(`test_no_type_errors` and `test_no_ruff_errors`).

Also removed the now-unused `check_no_ruff_errors` helper from
`imbue/imbue_common/ratchet_testing/ratchets.py`: its only callers were the
deleted per-project `test_no_ruff_errors` tests, and the repo-wide ruff test
runs its own `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` invocations rather than using
the helper. (`check_no_type_errors` is kept, since the repo-wide type test uses it.)

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-27

# ty 0.0.39 suppression syntax

- Converted bracketed `# type: ignore[...]` suppressions to `# ty: ignore[...]`, as required by `ty` 0.0.39 (which no longer honors the mypy-style bracketed form). Affected: the `field_ref` proxy returns in `frozen_model`/`mutable_model`, the `entry_points` cache monkeypatch in `conftest_hooks`, and an event-level assignment in the event-envelope test.

- Tightened this project's `test_ratchets.py` violation counts to their exact current values (`--inline-snapshot=trim`).

No user-facing behavior change.

## 2026-05-26

- Pruned non-notable entries (test-only changes, internal refactors, and doc-only tweaks with no user-facing effect) from this project's CHANGELOG.md, per the new notable-only changelog policy.

Add a `PREVENT_BARE_TMUX_TARGETS` ratchet rule (and `check_bare_tmux_targets` helper)
that flags `tmux <subcmd> ... -t '<target>'` or `... -t "<target>"` where the quoted
target doesn't begin with `=`. Scans every tracked file type, not just `.py`, so
shell scripts and other non-Python tmux call sites are also covered. Use it from
project ratchet suites (mngr does, via `rc.check_bare_tmux_targets`).

Context: bare-name tmux targets fall back to session prefix matching, which can route
commands meant for a stopped session to a still-running sibling whose name starts with
the same prefix. Routing all `-t` argument construction through the
`TmuxSessionTarget` / `TmuxWindowTarget` classes in `imbue.mngr.hosts.tmux`
(via `.as_shell_arg()`) prepends `=` for exact-match resolution; this ratchet enforces
that convention.

Promote `BINARY_FILE_EXCLUSION` (a tuple of binary-file globs that would otherwise
trip `.read_text()` with `UnicodeDecodeError`) to a public `Final` constant in
`imbue.imbue_common.ratchet_testing.core` so the project ratchets and the repo-wide
meta-ratchets share one canonical list.

## 2026-05-22

- The shared conftest hooks now set `LATCHKEY_DISABLE_COUNTING=1` in `os.environ` once per pytest session. Any subprocess spawned by a test (directly or transitively, e.g. the Latchkey Gateway started by the minds Electron e2e test) inherits the opt-out, so test runs no longer count toward Latchkey's public daily usage counter.

## 2026-05-21

Fix the intro in `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` so it references the correct entries directory. The path was `changelog/<project>/` (which never existed); the actual layout is `<project_dir>/changelog/`.

## 2026-05-20

Project now participates in the per-project changelog layout: a `changelog/` subdirectory holds per-PR entry files, and `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` at the project root hold the consolidated history. See the full rationale in `dev/changelog/mngr-changelog-per-project.md`.

## 2026-05-08

- imbue_common: extend `TEST_FILE_PATTERNS` (used by all standard ratchet checks to skip test files) from `("*_test.py", "test_*.py")` to `("*_test.py", "test_*.py", "conftest.py", "testing.py")` -- aligning with the wheel-exclude pattern from #1505 so `testing.py` and `conftest.py` are uniformly recognized as test code across ratchets. Existing snapshots are not affected (the change can only reduce violation counts; current snapshots are upper bounds).
