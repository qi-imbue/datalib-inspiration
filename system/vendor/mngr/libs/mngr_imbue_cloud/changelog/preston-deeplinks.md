`mngr imbue_cloud auth oauth` gained a `--success-redirect-url` option. When set, the localhost callback listener's success page shows the minds wordmark, a "You're in!" message, and an "Open app" link to that URL instead of telling the user to return to their terminal. The minds desktop app passes its `minds://` deeplink here so completing a browser OAuth sign-in offers a one-click hop back to the app.

The sign-in success page is also restyled: centered layout, system fonts, and light/dark color-scheme support instead of bare unstyled HTML.
