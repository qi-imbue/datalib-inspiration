## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud sync ...` transport CLI (records pull/push/delete, scrub-secrets, bundle pull/push/delete) plus matching connector-client methods and wire models. Pure transport for the minds workspace-sync feature — the plugin never encrypts, decrypts, or interprets the secret payloads. Push commands accept `--input-file` so payloads never ride a command line.
- Added: `ImbueCloudProvider.rename_host` — a leased host is renamed by updating its mutable `host_name` via the connector. The lease's `host_db_id` remains the durable identity, so a rename never touches the VPS or container and works whether or not the container is running.
- Added: Per-box FCT image cache for bare-metal slice bakes — the first production (`--from-tag`) slice baked on a box builds the forever-claude-template image (with Playwright/Chromium baked in) and saves it to a box-local tar; every subsequent slice on that box `docker load`s that tar instead of rebuilding. Removes the per-slice 10-20 minute image build and the ~900s first-boot Playwright install for all but the first slice. The image transfers entirely over the box's own loopback. Dev (`--workspace-dir`) bakes are unchanged.
- Added: OVH bare-metal **"slices"** — pool hosts carved out of bare-metal servers we rent, by running lima/QEMU VMs on them. A slice is indistinguishable from a baked VPS pool host to minds and the imbue_cloud provider, but with cleaner btrfs (the lima data disk, no loopback). Adds a new `mngr imbue_cloud admin server` lifecycle (`order` / `await-delivery` / `setup` / `prep` / `list` / `register` / `set-status` / `pricing`), and the slice bake flows through `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create`.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server order` places a real OVH eco order (`--plan-code` / `--region` / `--memory-gb` / `--storage`). **THIS CHARGES the account.** Mandatory option families are auto-picked from the catalog; ambiguous families are exposed via repeatable `--option <planCode>` (running `order` once without it lists each ambiguous family's offers and prices). Companion `await-delivery` polls until delivered (~1h) and `setup` provisions the box to `ready` (OS reinstall via `/dedicated/server/{s}/reinstall`, then box prep).
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server pricing` — read-only per-slice pricing table for OVH bare-metal plans, sorted cheapest-per-slice first. Each row is a server × RAM config × region and reports effective slot count, vCPUs/slice, disk/slice, and true month-to-month cost per slice. Knobs: `--region` (repeatable), `--memory-per-slice-gb` (default 8), `--cpu-overcommit` (default 2.0). Reads only the OVH catalog / availability APIs; never places an order.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --max-concurrency N` (default 4) bounds slice-bake parallelism — bakes at most N at once and queues the rest. The per-create timeout is raised to 45 minutes for slices. After bakes finish, the slice backend reconciles lima VMs and **lima data disks** against the pool DB and reaps any orphan (also runs on SIGTERM/SIGINT).
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --slice-env-name <env>` stamps the owning environment into each slice's lima names (`mngr-slice-<env>-<host-hex>`); paired with the new `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool teardown-slices` command (tears down every unleased slice VM recorded in the pool DB), multiple developer environments can safely share a single bare-metal slice box. Each slice carve reserves its slot and host ports under a brief box-wide lock so concurrent bakes from different envs never collide. Legacy un-stamped slices keep working and are never touched.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --from-tag <tag>` now bakes the mngr vendored at that tag instead of silently overriding the FCT clone's `vendor/mngr/` with the operator's local checkout — so a `--from-tag` bake is byte-for-byte tag content, mngr included.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool backfill-host-keys` — one-shot command that keyscans pre-existing pool rows and boxes to populate the new SSH host-key columns; the single sanctioned, migration-only TOFU. After it runs, leasing fails closed on any row missing a pinned key rather than falling back to a scan.
- Added: `--skip-deferred-install-wait` flag on `admin pool create` — when set, the bake does not wait for the FCT deferred-install (heavy apt + Playwright/Chromium) to finish before stopping the baked services agent. Saves a few minutes per bake for dev/throwaway hosts; must never be used for production pool hosts (stopping mid-apt can corrupt dpkg).
- Added: The imbue_cloud fast path now matches on the **repository** as well as the branch/tag, so it can no longer adopt a pool host running different code than the request asked for. A new `repo_identity.canonicalize_repo_source` normalizes remote URL forms (ssh/https, `.git`, trailing slash, host case) and resolves a local path to its `origin` remote; applied identically at bake time and request time. `admin pool create` no longer accepts hand-typed identity in `--attributes`; it derives canonical `repo_url` + `repo_branch_or_tag` from the bake source, which is now exactly one of `--from-tag <tag>` (production) or `--workspace-dir <dir>` (dev).
- Added: A 32 GiB swapfile is now provisioned on bare-metal boxes by `admin server prep`.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server order --dry-run` — builds and prices a non-committal OVH cart, prints the real price preview plus derived server specs and slice count, then deletes the cart without ordering. No charge, no interactive prompt, no DB write. Takes precedence over `--yes`, so `--dry-run --yes` never charges.
- Added: Agent listings populate `AgentDetails.pid` (the agent's main-process PID in the remote host's PID namespace), extracted from the same already-collected tmux/ps probe data.

### Changed

- Changed: forever-claude-template renamed to default-workspace-template. The per-box template image cache tag prefix becomes `default-workspace-template:` (from `fct:`) and the per-box cache dir becomes `.cache/mngr-slice-default-workspace-template` (from `.cache/mngr-slice-fct`); boxes prepped under the old dir keep working, as their first `--from-tag` bake rebuilds the image once and re-seeds the cache under the new name.
- Changed: Imbue Cloud provider updated for mngr's new per-provider discovery — implements the bounded `discover_hosts_and_agents_within_timeouts` entry point. Because discovery reads all leased hosts and their agents in one batched pass, individual host reads are not separately bounded (still bounded by the provider-level discovery error timeout; no host is marked UNKNOWN by this path).
- Changed: Pre-baked pool hosts are no longer stamped with a `workspace=<name>` label at bake time; workspace identity lives on the host name and host id, not on a label.
- Changed: **SSH host keys pinned end-to-end, removing TOFU from the imbue_cloud pool flow.** Each baked slice gets unique VM-root and container sshd host keys (no longer shared across an operator's slices). The bake records each pool host's VPS/VM-root and container sshd host public keys into the connector's `pool_hosts` row, and OVH bare-metal boxes get an ed25519 host key generated and injected during OS reinstall (recorded on the `bare_metal_servers` row). Leasing returns both host keys so the client pins them with strict host-key checking instead of scanning; the slow-path container rebuild pins its own freshly-generated key. The lima slice client, admin box SSH, and connector lease/teardown all pin the recorded key rather than disabling host-key checking. `mngr imbue_cloud admin server prep` now takes `--server-id` (instead of `--server-address`) and strictly pins the box's recorded sshd host key — there is no TOFU fallback.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` now requires `--server-id` — baking always targets an explicitly-chosen, ready bare-metal server rather than auto-selecting one.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` validates `--region` against the known lease regions (`US-EAST-VA`, `US-WEST-OR`) and fails fast on anything else (most importantly a raw OVH datacenter code like `vin`, which `admin server list` prints). Previously a free-form region stamped onto `pool_hosts` made the host permanently unleasable.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool list` (and the `minds pool list` wrapper) now emits every `pool_hosts` column (instead of a hand-maintained 10-column subset), so a baked slice no longer shows up looking like a region-less OVH VPS.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool destroy` tears down the row's slice lima VM and data disk on the bare-metal box (freeing the slot) before the row is dropped, so a teardown failure keeps the row and the operation stays retryable. Slice teardown reads the pool management key from `POOL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server prep` now pre-installs the pinned Docker Engine and `inotify-tools` into the staged golden slice image via `virt-customize` (adds a `libguestfs-tools` box dependency), so slice carves no longer download/install Docker per VM — speeding up baking and removing a per-slice network dependency.
- Changed: Corrected bare-metal slice sizing so a box's slot count reflects what it can realistically run (also flows into `admin server pricing`). RAM overhead is now modeled in two parts (a per-machine host reserve + a per-VM overhead), so the guest gets its full advertised `memory_per_slice_gb` (previously it was silently shortchanged by the overhead). Disk no longer overcommits.
- Changed: `mngr list` discovery now reports a transport-level failure reaching the Imbue Cloud connector (connection refused, DNS failure, timeout) as a typed `ProviderUnavailableError` rather than a bare httpx error. Lets the minds recovery flow tell "the provider is unreachable, so a restart can't help — just retry" apart from "your workspace can't be reached for another reason".
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool destroy` now accepts multiple pool-host ids and destroys them concurrently (bounded by `--max-concurrency`, default 8), regardless of which bare-metal box each slice is on. It keeps going through failures and emits a per-host outcome report, exiting non-zero only when a VM teardown actually failed. Each row is atomically claimed (flipped to `removing` in a committed transaction) before any teardown, so the connector's `/hosts/lease` can never hand a mid-destroy host to a user; a row leased first is reported as `skipped_leased` and a failed teardown leaves the row `removing` so the same command retries it.
- Changed: `admin pool destroy` no longer requires `--force` for `available` (and stale `removing`) rows — the old `status != 'released'` guard was vestigial. `--force` now specifically means "also destroy rows currently leased" (funneled through the same atomic claim, so the user's later release lands as an idempotent no-op).
- Changed: `admin pool destroy --skip-vps-cancel` is replaced by `--drop-row-only` (clean break) — a row-only drop for rows whose bare-metal box record is gone or whose machine is permanently dead. Goes through the same atomic claim.
- Changed: `admin pool teardown-slices` now claims each row as `removing` before teardown, tears the slice VMs down through the same parallel helper (with its own `--max-concurrency`, default 8), and includes rows already stranded in `removing` (e.g. by a crashed connector release) so an env destroy no longer leaks their VMs or rows.
- Changed: DB-side slot accounting now counts `removing` rows as still occupying their box slot (their VM may still be tearing down), so `admin server list` capacity numbers stay truthful while destroys run.
- Changed: The bake and destroy fan-outs share one bounded parallel helper (`run_outcome_workers_in_bounded_threads`); their per-item outcomes and summary reports are typed FrozenModels (`SliceBakeOutcome`/`SliceBakeReport`, `PoolHostDestroyOutcome`/`PoolHostDestroyReport`) with `LowerCaseStrEnum` statuses. The emitted JSON wire format is unchanged.

### Removed

- Removed: Legacy OVH-VPS pool-host backend from `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool`. `admin pool create` is slice-only (dropped `--backend`, `--tag`, `--management-public-key-file`, `--no-recycle`; `--server-id` is required), `admin pool destroy` always tears down the slice's lima VM before dropping the row, and the `backend_kind` discriminator (CLI/value/column) is gone. OVH as the bare-metal-box supplier is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed: "Husk" bug where a transiently-unreachable leased workspace (a sleep/wifi blip or a brief box outage) lost its agent labels and disappeared from consumers that filter on them — most importantly the minds sidebar's `is_primary` guard, which dropped the workspace and made a restart 404 with "Unknown workspace". The provider now remembers, per host, the identity (name + `certified_data`, including labels) of every agent seen in the last successful discovery pass, persisted to disk under the host's existing state dir. When a later pass cannot reach the host (or lists zero agents), discovery re-attaches the full cached set — each agent marked `"stale": true` so consumers can tell cached identity from a live listing — instead of emitting a single label-less stub. An unreachable host now surfaces as UNKNOWN (auth failures still surface as UNAUTHENTICATED), with the real failure reason preserved: unreachability is non-evidence about the container, the two indistinguishable client-side. Visibility consequences: `mngr list --active` no longer hides unreachable hosts (it excludes CRASHED but not UNKNOWN), and `mngr wait --host` no longer treats an unreachable host as terminal.
- Fixed: Imbue Cloud provider now reports the container's outer-host-loopback SSH port (`get_container_loopback_ssh_port`), which is the fixed in-VM publish port (`config.container_ssh_port`) rather than the externally-routable box-forwarded port a remote client connects to. On a lima slice the publish and connect ports differ, and using the connect port broke the VPS-resident latchkey gateway's reverse tunnel into the agent's container, leaving agents without latchkey access whenever the desktop gateway was offline.
- Fixed: Connector HTTP client now retries `httpx.TransportError` with bounded exponential backoff (idempotent GET/PUT/DELETE retry on any transport error; lease/create POSTs retry only on connect-phase errors to avoid double-allocation) and raises a clean domain error (`ImbueCloud*Error`) on terminal failure. The connector is a scale-to-zero Modal app, so a call that hit a cold/scaling instance previously surfaced as a raw httpx traceback — this fixes the intermittent `502 tunnels list failed` an agent hit when toggling workspace sharing through the minds API.
- Fixed: Per-box FCT image seed now invokes `uv run python -m playwright install` instead of the `playwright` console script. The FCT image builds its uv venv at `/mngr/code` and relocates the workspace to `/docker_build_code`; uv venv shebangs hardcode the original path, so the `playwright` script failed to spawn from the relocated workspace and every production (`--from-tag`) slice bake was unable to produce the box tar. Invoking via `python -m` goes through the venv's relocatable interpreter symlink and succeeds.
- Fixed: Restarting a stopped imbue_cloud (leased pool) mind no longer leaves it in a broken, unrecoverable state. `ImbueCloudProvider.get_host` now probes the inner container's running state over the outer root SSH (mirroring `VpsDockerProvider.get_host`) and returns an offline host when the container is stopped, so `mngr start` routes through `start_host`. `start_host` then relaunches the container's sshd over the outer root SSH (the in-container sshd is started via `docker exec` and does not survive a `docker stop`/`start`, but the container filesystem -- including the per-host authorized key and the served host key -- is preserved across the restart) and waits for it to accept connections.
- Fixed: `mngr create` on the imbue_cloud fast path (`fast_mode=require`) tolerates start args the pre-baked pool-host container already carries (`--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, `--workdir=/`, `--restart=unless-stopped`) instead of failing with "does not accept --image or --start-arg". Any other start arg, or an `--image` swap, still requires `fast_mode=prevent` to rebuild.
- Fixed: Host lock reporting for imbue_cloud pool hosts now derives status from a real flock held-probe rather than the lock file's presence.
- Fixed: Slice fast-path leases no longer hang at "Waiting for initial chat agent..." — the slice bake now stops the `system-services` agent post-bake so the lease starts it fresh.
- Fixed: Bare-metal box-prep bug that made every slice bake fail with `mkdir ~/.cache/lima: permission denied` — prep now creates and chowns the cache dir chain to the lima user (and repairs an already-root-owned `~/.cache` when re-run).
- Fixed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server setup` now retries the OVH OS reinstall when OVH transiently fails its OS-compatibility lookup for a valid template (the `"retrieving compatibility details"` error) instead of aborting the whole setup. The generated SSH host key is created once and reused across attempts so the pinned host key stays stable; non-transient OVH errors still propagate immediately.
- Fixed: Streaming discovery path (feeding `mngr observe` and the desktop-side Latchkey reverse tunnel) now pins the connector-recorded container sshd host key for each leased host's inner-container SSH endpoint in the per-host `known_hosts` file. Previously only the outer VPS-root key was pinned, so a strict host-key-checked SSH connection to the advertised container endpoint could fail with `Server '[<vps_address>]:<container_ssh_port>' not found in known_hosts` (recurring Sentry events from `mngr latchkey forward`) — now matching the full `get_host` path.
- Fixed: Git commits on imbue cloud pool hosts are no longer attributed to the operator who baked the host. The pool-host finalize step now unsets the repo-local git identity in the baked `/mngr/code` checkout before shipping, so the workspace bootstrap re-supplies its own neutral fallback on adoption. Local `mngr` worktree agents are unaffected.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server order --option <planCode>` (repeatable) lets you order plans whose mandatory option families (e.g. bandwidth, vrack) offer more than one choice. Previously the cart build failed with "expected exactly one X option to auto-pick" on such plans (e.g. the `24sys*` SYS line). Single-offer families are still auto-selected; an `order` run without `--option` on an ambiguous plan now lists each family's offers and their monthly prices so you can re-run with the right values.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --backend slice --max-concurrency N` (default 4) bounds slice-bake parallelism: bakes at most N at once and queues the rest, reporting progress as each completes. Keeps box contention low enough that each `mngr create` finishes within its per-create timeout (raised to 45 minutes for slices). After bakes finish, the slice backend reconciles lima VMs and **lima data disks** against the pool DB and reaps any orphan; the reap also runs on a top-level SIGTERM/SIGINT.

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool destroy` is now backend-aware (mirroring the `--backend` branch in `pool create`). A `slice` row destroys its lima VM and data disk on the bare-metal box (freeing the slot) before the row is dropped; an `ovh_vps` row (including legacy rows written before the column existed) cancels its OVH VPS as before. Either teardown runs before the row delete, so a failure keeps the row and the operation stays retryable. `--skip-vps-cancel` still drops the row only, for any backend. Direct `admin pool destroy` of a slice requires `POOL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `minds pool destroy` wrapper injects it from Vault).
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server prep` now pre-installs the pinned Docker Engine and `inotify-tools` into the staged golden slice image via `virt-customize` (adds a `libguestfs-tools` box dependency). Slice carves no longer download/install Docker per VM, which speeds up baking (especially in parallel) and removes a per-slice network dependency. `server prep` also now provisions a 32 GiB swapfile.
- Changed: Corrected bare-metal slice sizing so a box's slot count reflects what it can realistically run (this also flows into `admin server pricing`). RAM overhead is now modeled in two parts (a per-machine host reserve and a per-VM overhead) so the guest gets its full advertised `memory_per_slice_gb`. Disk no longer overcommits: the reserve absorbs the GB-vs-GiB gap plus partition/filesystem overhead.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --backend slice` now requires `--server-id` (the bare-metal box to bake slices onto, from `admin server list`). Baking always targets an explicitly-chosen, ready server rather than auto-selecting one.

### Removed

- Removed: Dead `create_snapshot`, `delete_snapshot`, `list_snapshots`, and `list_ssh_keys` stubs from `LimaSliceVpsClient`, matching the slimmed-down `VpsClientInterface`. No user-facing behavior change: these methods only ever raised "unavailable".

### Fixed

- Fixed: Bare-metal box-prep bug that made every slice bake fail with `mkdir ~/.cache/lima: permission denied`. The prep script (run as root) staged the slice base image under the lima user's `~/.cache` but left `~/.cache` itself root-owned, so `limactl` (run as the lima user) could not create `~/.cache/lima`. Prep now creates and chowns the cache dir chain to the lima user, and repairs an already-root-owned `~/.cache` when re-run.

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Changed: `destroy_host` now raises a `CleanupFailedGroup` carrying the classified cleanup failures (instead of returning them, or swallowing errors as warnings) when a resource is left behind, and returns normally otherwise. A leased VPS that cannot be released back to the pool is recorded as a `HOST_RESOURCE_REMAINS` failure (the data-wipe step on the VPS stays best-effort / warn-only because the released VPS is destroyed wholesale by `cleanup_released_hosts.py`), so `mngr destroy`/`cleanup` can surface it and exit with a cause-specific code. See `specs/cleanup-error-aggregation.md`.

### Removed

- Removed: Dead `create_snapshot`, `delete_snapshot`, `list_snapshots`, and `list_ssh_keys` stub overrides from `LimaSliceVpsClient`, matching the removal of those abstract methods from the shared `VpsClientInterface`.

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added: OVH bare-metal "slices" feature — carve VPS-like hosts (lima/QEMU VMs) out of rented OVH bare-metal servers as an alternative to ordering OVH VPSes. A slice is indistinguishable from a baked VPS pool host to minds and the imbue_cloud provider, with cleaner btrfs (the lima data disk, no loopback). Includes the slice data model + lifecycle (`bare_metal.py`), lima slice creation (`build_slice_lima_yaml`, `LimaSliceVpsClient`), and a `SliceVpsDockerProvider` that runs the shared vps_docker bake on the VM.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin server` command group for the bare-metal lifecycle — `pricing` (per-slice OVH pricing table), `order` (places a real OVH eco order; **charges the account**), `await-delivery`, `setup` (resumable Debian reinstall + box prep), `register`, `list`, `set-status`. Codifies the full RAM-pricing → order → deliver → provision → slice flow that was previously done by hand.
- Added: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create --backend [ovh_vps|slice]` unifies pool-host baking across backends — there is now a single command to bake a leasable pool host regardless of backend (the machine-provisioning step differs; the bake + row insert are shared). Slice rows go through the same lease-metadata path as OVH, carrying the operator's `--attributes` and `--region`.
- Added: `--skip-deferred-install-wait` flag on `admin pool create` (slice + ovh_vps) for faster dev/throwaway pool bakes that skip the FCT deferred-install (heavy apt + Playwright/Chromium) wait; must not be used for production pool hosts.

### Changed

- Changed: Pool bake now waits for the FCT `deferred-install` service to finish before stopping the services agent, on both the OVH-VPS and slice paths. Stopping mid-apt previously corrupted dpkg, leaving the deferred install failing on every post-lease retry until repaired.
- Changed: `admin pool create` no longer accepts hand-typed `repo_url` / `repo_branch_or_tag` in `--attributes`. The bake source is now exactly one of `--from-tag <tag>` (production — clones `--repo-url` at the tag into a fresh temp dir so the content provably equals the tag) or `--workspace-dir <dir>` (dev — bakes from a working tree). `--attributes` is now optional and rejects the `repo_url` / `repo_branch_or_tag` keys.
- Changed: imbue_cloud fast path now matches on the **repository** as well as the branch/tag, so it can no longer adopt a pool host running different code than the request asked for. A new `repo_identity.canonicalize_repo_source` is the single source of truth applied identically at bake time and request time (normalizes ssh/https, `.git`, trailing slash, host case; resolves a local path to its `origin` remote). `fast_mode=require` now raises `FastPathUnavailableError` when canonical identity cannot be established, instead of matching on a subset.
- Changed: Restructured the `mngr_imbue_cloud` plugin into layered sub-packages (`plugin`, `cli`, `bake`, `providers`, `hosts`, `slices`, `connector`) with an `import-linter` "mngr_imbue_cloud layers contract" enforcing the ordering. The slice/bare-metal subsystem is isolated in `slices/`, the provider-generic pool bake in `bake/`, and both provider backends are co-located in `plugin/backends.py`. Plugin entry points moved to `imbue.mngr_imbue_cloud.plugin.entrypoints` / `plugin.slice_entrypoints`. Pure refactor: no behavior, CLI, wire-format, or schema change.
- Changed: Decomposed the oversized `providers/instance.py` (~2,000 lines) — extracted the pure listing-shaping helpers into `providers/listing.py`, the pre-release data-wipe script generator into `providers/wipe.py`, and the slow-path VPS-vs-slice rebuild provider/config builders into `providers/rebuild.py` (with their unit tests co-located).
- Changed: The imbue_cloud provider now reaches a leased host's outer (VPS-root) sshd at the lease's `ssh_port` instead of a hardcoded 22, so `mngr list` / discovery and destroy-time wipe target the slice VM rather than the bare-metal box's own sshd.
- Changed: The slow-path rebuild now pins the leased host's outer SSH host key in the rebuilding provider's known_hosts, so the certified-data sync over the outer connection passes strict host-key checking (applies to OVH VPSes and slices).

## [v0.1.3] - 2026-06-15

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Changed: A stopped (offline) host's files are now readable through the same interface as an online host (used e.g. by Claude session preservation when a host is destroyed while offline). The host's volume is resolved lazily on first read, so this adds no per-host probe to host discovery; when no volume is available, reads behave as "nothing there".
- Changed: `_build_delegated_vps_provider` now returns a `MinimalVpsDockerProvider` (moved into `mngr_vps_docker`, since it's a generally useful role for any externally-managed-VPS host-setup path). Its `_parse_build_args` extracts `--git-depth=N` and forwards everything else to docker, which is the correct behavior for the no-provisioning path that pairs with `ExternallyManagedVpsClient`; without this, every slow-path container rebuild raised before any docker work happened (the base `_parse_build_args` is `@abstractmethod` now).
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` now passes `--ovh-datacenter=` instead of the retired `--vps-datacenter=` to the inner `mngr create --provider ovh`, keeping pool creation working after the OVH provider's per-provider build-arg prefix rename.
- Changed: Replaced direct ValueError/RuntimeError raises in build-arg parsing and host provisioning with dedicated custom exception types.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added: `--no-recycle` flag on `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` that forces a fresh OVH VPS order (sets `MNGR__PROVIDERS__OVH__ENABLE_RECYCLE_CANCELLED=false` on the inner `mngr create`) instead of reclaiming a cancelled (still-billable) VPS, for exercising the fresh-provision path.
- Added: Region-aware leasing — `mngr create` against imbue_cloud accepts a hard `-b region=<datacenter>` build arg (lease fails if no host is available in that datacenter), validated against the known OVH-US datacenters (`US-EAST-VA`, `US-WEST-OR`), and applied on both the fast and slow paths. `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` records the bake `--region` so the connector can filter on it.
- Added: Auto-discovered as a publishable package by the release tooling; will be offered for first publication to PyPI on the next release.

### Changed

- Changed: Rebuilt containers now run under the gVisor (`runsc`) runtime with `--workdir=/` and `no-new-privileges` hardening args, configured per account by minds bootstrap.
- Changed: The imbue_cloud slow (rebuild) path now re-applies the full idempotent host setup (pinned Docker version, gVisor `runsc` install/registration, sshd tuning, base packages) on the leased VPS before rebuilding the container, so a workspace created via the slow path — even on a host baked before runsc existed — comes up consistent and runs its agent container under gVisor. A failure is fatal.

### Removed

- Removed: The soft `-b preferred_region=<dc>` lease build arg. A lease is now constrained only by the hard `-b region=<dc>` arg; when unset, the lease is region-agnostic.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added: New `mngr imbue_cloud bucket` command group (`create` / `list` / `info` / `destroy`) for managing per-host R2 buckets (paid accounts only), plus `bucket keys create/list/destroy` for minting and revoking bucket-scoped S3 keys (read-only or read-write). `bucket create` returns S3-compatible credentials as JSON; the secret is shown only once and never stored. `bucket destroy` refuses a non-empty bucket and otherwise cascades to revoke its keys.
- Added: A pure helper exposing the rendered host-wipe shell script so it can be unit-tested without an SSH transport.
- Added: New `mngr imbue_cloud admin paid` subcommands for managing the connector's paid-user lists: `paid domain add|remove|list` and `paid email add|remove|list` (with `--paid-only` on list). These talk to the connector's `/paid/*` admin API using the fixed API key read from `$MINDS_PAID_ADMIN_KEY` (or `--api-key`). Matching client methods and a `PaidListEntry` data type are exposed.
- Added: Robust "slow path" for imbue_cloud host leasing, selected by a new `-b fast_mode=require|prevent` build arg. `require` adopts an exactly-matching pre-baked agent (the original fast path); `prevent` (the new default) leases any adequately-sized host and rebuilds its container from the FCT Dockerfile, releasing the lease if setup fails.

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr destroy <agent>` against an imbue_cloud-leased pool host is now terminal rather than a soft `docker stop`. The new flow stops + removes the workspace container, drops the per-host docker volume and btrfs subvolume, prunes the system, wipes `/root` + `/tmp` (preserving `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`), releases the lease back to the pool, then cleans up local per-host state. Privacy-first ordering wipes data before flipping the row to `released`. `mngr delete <agent>` runs the same flow and is a safe no-op for an already-released lease. Use `mngr stop <agent>` instead to pause the container without releasing the lease.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool destroy` (and the `minds pool destroy` wrapper) now do a full teardown: cancel the OVH VPS (strip per-lease tags + `deleteAtExpiration`) before dropping the row, so destruction can no longer strand a still-billing VPS. Pass `--skip-vps-cancel` only when the VPS is already gone. The provider's `destroy_host` now also raises when the connector release fails instead of silently cleaning up local state, so a failed release no longer makes mngr "forget" a host whose lease/VPS is still live.
- Changed: Stopped masking errors in the lease/teardown paths — host-listing and host-release failures now raise instead of being swallowed (the create-rollback path still catches release errors explicitly to stay best-effort).
- Changed: Bumped the `imbue-mngr` pin from `0.2.8` to `0.2.10` to align with main's release commit, so building the `apps/minds` ToDesktop bundle from main no longer fails at `uv lock`.
- Changed: Simplified an exception handler now that the host error types are all `MngrError` subclasses. No behavior change.
- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` is now provider-generic — adds a required `--region REGION` and repeatable `--tag KEY=VALUE`, defaults to the OVH templates/provider, and installs + configures `ufw` on every leased VPS.
- Changed: A leased host now adopts the user-supplied host name (rewritten into the container) so the FCT bootstrap's initial chat uses the user's chosen name instead of the bake's placeholder.
- Changed: The bake's services agent now uses the constant name `system-services`, and the bake clears the FCT bootstrap's initial-chat state so the user's first start re-fires it cleanly.
- Changed: Agent lookup now filters by both agent name and host name, so an operator's local state accumulating one `system-services` agent per bake no longer routes calls to the wrong VPS.
- Changed: Offline plugin fields are now populated for leased hosts that fall back to offline/lease-only data.
- Changed: Added to the release tooling's publish graph; will be offered for first publication to PyPI on the next release. Previously-unpinned internal deps are now pinned, as a published wheel requires. No runtime change.

### Removed

- Removed: Dead env-injection helpers; the central `MINDS_API_KEY` is now injected on the fly by the latchkey gateway's `minds-api-proxy` extension and no longer needs to be pushed onto leased pool hosts.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `pool_hosts` INSERT now picks up the schema's `host_name` column; every successful pool bake had been dying at the last step with `null value in column "host_name"` and leaking a fully-provisioned VPS.
- Fixed: Multi-token `mngr exec` commands packed into a single `shlex.join`'d positional string so click no longer eats `--force` as a `mngr exec` option.
- Fixed: `mngr imbue_cloud auth oauth` no longer hangs until the 300s timeout after the browser already returned the OAuth code. The local callback listener now only records query params when the request is for `/oauth/callback` with non-empty params, so secondary GETs (favicon, prefetches) can no longer overwrite the captured callback with `{}`.
- Fixed: The slow (rebuild) path no longer trips on `python3: not found`. A rebuilt host was wrongly treated as carrying a pre-baked agent, so provisioning took the minimal "adopt" path; it now runs the standard full create + provision pipeline.
- Fixed: Pool-host bake no longer writes the wrong value into the VPS instance id column, which had broken every connector-side OVH teardown.

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr list` for `imbue_cloud` now drives discovery through outer (VPS-root) SSH instead of inner-container SSH, showing true container state (`RUNNING`/`STOPPED`/`CRASHED`/`PAUSED`/`DESTROYED`) and full details even when inner sshd is unreachable.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added: New `mngr_imbue_cloud` plugin with `mngr imbue_cloud` CLI (`auth`, `hosts`, `keys litellm`, `tunnels`, `admin pool`) that owns SuperTokens auth, pool-host leasing, LiteLLM keys, and Cloudflare tunnels; multi-account modelled as multiple provider instances.

### Changed

- Changed: `mngr imbue_cloud admin pool create` post-create read-back is now scoped to `--provider` (default `vultr`) and uses `--on-error continue`; broken `just create-pool-hosts*` recipes and `apps/remote_service_connector/scripts/create_pool_hosts.py` deleted in favour of the plugin command.
