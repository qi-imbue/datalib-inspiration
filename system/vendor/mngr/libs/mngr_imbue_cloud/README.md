# mngr_imbue_cloud

Provider backend plugin and CLI for Imbue Cloud, the imbue-team-hosted leasing service for pre-provisioned pool hosts. All functionality is reachable through `mngr` commands: auth, account plans/quotas, host leasing, LiteLLM virtual keys, R2 buckets, and Cloudflare tunnels.

## Configuration

Each signed-in account is its own provider instance entry in `~/.mngr/config.toml`:

```toml
[providers.imbue_cloud_alice]
backend = "imbue_cloud"
account = "alice@imbue.com"
# connector_url is optional; when unset, the env var below is used.
```

There is no baked-in default connector URL: it comes from the per-instance `connector_url` field, or, when that is unset, the `MNGR__PROVIDERS__IMBUE_CLOUD__CONNECTOR_URL` environment variable. If neither is set, the provider raises.

## Sign in

```bash
mngr imbue_cloud auth signin --account alice@imbue.com
# or browser-based OAuth:
mngr imbue_cloud auth oauth google --account alice@imbue.com
```

## Account plans and quotas

Every account has a plan ("explorer" by default; "ally" grants higher limits and requires a paid-listed email) whose quotas cap resource use: remote workspaces, tunnels, services per tunnel, buckets, total bucket storage, monthly LLM spend, and synced workspaces. The connector enforces quotas at grant time and returns a structured 403 (`quota_exceeded`, with the entitlement name, limit, and current usage) when a cap is hit.

```bash
# Show the plan, entitlement values, and live usage.
mngr imbue_cloud account show

# Switch plans (re-selecting the current plan is a no-op; switching to
# "ally" errors with the reason unless the email is paid-listed).
mngr imbue_cloud account set-plan ally
```

Operators manage individual accounts by email with `mngr imbue_cloud admin account show|set-plan|set-quota` (authenticated by `$MINDS_ADMIN_KEY`, like `admin paid`). `set-plan` resets the account to the plan's defaults; `set-quota` bumps one entitlement value. `mngr imbue_cloud admin sweep r2 [--email <email>]` runs one R2 storage-quota sweep pass on demand (enforcement, grant settlement, key invariants) instead of waiting for the hourly cron.

## Create an agent on a leased host

Use the standard `mngr create` pipeline -- the provider leases a pool host and bootstraps it, and the rest of create adopts the pool's pre-baked agent under your chosen name:

```bash
mngr create my-agent@my-host.imbue_cloud_alice --new-host \
    -b repo_url=https://github.com/imbue-ai/default-workspace-template \
    -b repo_branch_or_tag=v1.2.3
```

The recognized build args (`repo_url`, `repo_branch_or_tag`, `cpus`, `memory_gb`, `gpu_count`) select which pool host to lease. Any other `-b` entry (e.g. `--file=Dockerfile`, `.`) is forwarded as a build arg to the slow-path container rebuild.

## Fast path vs. slow path (`fast_mode`)

`mngr create` against imbue_cloud can land on a pool host two ways, selected by `-b fast_mode=<require|prevent>`:

- **`fast_mode=require`** (fast path) -- lease a pool host that exactly matches and adopt its pre-baked agent. Almost no client-side setup is needed. If no exact match is available, this raises `FastPathUnavailableError` rather than falling back.
- **`fast_mode=prevent`** (slow path, the **default**) -- lease any adequately-sized available host, rebuild its container from your `Dockerfile`, and do full client-side setup, as if it were a fresh host.

The slow path needs a usable build context: run `mngr create` from (or `--project` at) a default-workspace-template checkout whose `imbue_cloud` create template supplies the Dockerfile build args. The logs state which path was taken (`FAST PATH` vs `SLOW PATH`).

If a step fails after a successful lease, the lease is released back to the pool before the error propagates. When the pool is empty, even the slow-path lease returns `ImbueCloudLeaseUnavailableError`.

minds drives this automatically: it tries `fast_mode=require` first and, on `FastPathUnavailableError`, retries with `fast_mode=prevent`.

## Destroy / delete / stop

- `mngr destroy <agent>` is **terminal**: it wipes the workspace and its data, then releases the lease back to the pool. The user's data is gone before the lease is released.
- `mngr delete <agent>` (or `mngr imbue_cloud hosts release <host-db-id>`) runs the same flow; it's the path mngr's GC takes after the destroyed-host grace period. Safe to re-run on an already-released lease.
- `mngr stop <agent>` is the "resume later" path: it stops the container but preserves the lease and on-disk data, and `mngr start <agent>` brings the same workspace back up.

## Buckets

Create an R2 bucket (for storing files remotely). Each bucket is isolated (think one per host) and has exactly **one** S3 key.

```bash
# Create a bucket; emits {bucket, key} where key includes the one-time secret.
mngr imbue_cloud bucket create my-backups --account alice@imbue.com

# List / inspect / destroy (destroy refuses a non-empty bucket).
mngr imbue_cloud bucket list
mngr imbue_cloud bucket info my-backups
mngr imbue_cloud bucket destroy my-backups

# Force-destroy: when the destroy is refused as non-empty, delete ALL of the
# bucket's contents (batched S3 deletes, client-side) and retry the destroy.
# The destroy is attempted first, so any other refusal (e.g. the
# active-workspace interlock below) aborts before anything is deleted.
# Prompts for confirmation unless -y. When the account is over its storage
# quota (keys downgraded to read-only), a cleanup grant temporarily restores
# write access for the deletion.
mngr imbue_cloud bucket destroy my-backups --force -y

# Get working credentials again: rolls the key's secret in place (same
# Access Key ID, fresh secret; the old secret stops working immediately).
mngr imbue_cloud bucket roll-key my-backups

# Inspect key metadata (never includes secrets).
mngr imbue_cloud bucket keys list                # all keys across buckets
mngr imbue_cloud bucket keys list my-backups     # just this bucket's key
```

The emitted credentials (`access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, `s3_endpoint`, `bucket_name`) are standard S3-compatible credentials -- point any S3 client at the endpoint. The secret is shown only once (at creation or roll) and is never stored by the service.

Two rules protect workspace backups (buckets whose short name is their workspace's host id, `host-<hex>`):

- `bucket create` reserves the `host-` short-name prefix: creating such a name is refused unless a workspace record with that host id exists for your account, so a generic bucket can never collide with a backup bucket.

- `bucket destroy` (with or without `--force`) refuses to destroy a workspace-backup bucket whose workspace record is still ACTIVE -- destroy the workspace first. Destroyed workspaces' backups are retained for 30 days and then reaped automatically by the connector (see the minds backup-retention docs).

**Note:** total storage across all your buckets is capped by your plan's quota. While over the cap, an hourly server-side sweep turns your bucket keys read-only (the same credentials keep working for reads); they are restored automatically once you are back under quota, and an account over its storage quota cannot create new buckets.

A read-only key cannot delete data (restic's `forget`/`prune` need full write access), so getting back under quota goes through a **cleanup grant**:

```bash
# Temporarily restore your downgraded keys to readwrite so cleanup can run.
mngr imbue_cloud account cleanup-grant

# ... run restic forget/prune (or delete objects) against your buckets ...

# Re-measure and settle: restores your keys immediately if you are now under
# quota, or re-downgrades if not.
mngr imbue_cloud account recheck-storage
```

Grants that actually reduce usage are unlimited; only grants that free nothing count against a small rolling budget (so a grant cannot be farmed for extra write time). `recheck-storage` also works standalone -- if you dropped under quota some other way, it restores your keys without waiting for the hourly sweep.
