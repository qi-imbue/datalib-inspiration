# Setup

One-time. Everything after this is `minds-evals`.

Results live in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. Your `mngr imbue_cloud` login already authorizes you to
create R2 buckets and scoped keys, so there is no AWS account, no IAM, and no admin credentials to
manage -- one command mints both the bucket and a bucket-scoped key.

## 1. Create the bucket + write the creds file (one command)

```
./setup-r2.sh                       # or: ./setup-r2.sh <bucket-name>
```

This runs `mngr imbue_cloud bucket create` and writes its output straight to `~/.minds-eval/r2.env`
(chmod 600) -- no copy-paste. Skip to step 3. The rest of this section is what it does under the hood.

`mngr imbue_cloud bucket create minds-eval-backups` prints JSON with everything you need -- the
bucket, its S3-compatible endpoint, and a scoped readwrite key (the `secret_access_key` is shown ONCE):

```json
{
  "bucket": {"bucket_name": "minds-eval-backups", "s3_endpoint": "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", ...},
  "key": {
    "access_key_id": "...",
    "secret_access_key": "...",
    "s3_endpoint": "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
    "bucket_name": "minds-eval-backups",
    "access": "readwrite"
  }
}
```

The key is already scoped to just this bucket, so it is safe to hand to the eval sandboxes (restic
writes snapshots to R2 from inside the workspace, where the agent runs arbitrary code and can read
the key). It can reach that one bucket and nothing else.

## 2. The credentials file (what setup-r2.sh writes)

The CLI reads this and mounts it into the box read-only. `setup-r2.sh` writes it for you; the four
values come from the `key` object above (R2 uses the standard `AWS_*` names -- that is what boto3
and restic read).

```
mkdir -p ~/.minds-eval
cat > ~/.minds-eval/r2.env <<EOF
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key.access_key_id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<key.secret_access_key>
MINDS_EVAL_BUCKET=<key.bucket_name>
MINDS_EVAL_S3_ENDPOINT=<key.s3_endpoint>
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.minds-eval/r2.env
```

(No region -- R2 ignores it; the CLI defaults it to `auto`.)

## 3. Anthropic key

Needed by `launch`: it is forwarded into each eval workspace's host env (so the agent authenticates
without the in-workspace sign-in modal) and used by the role-play worker on `DECIDE_FROM_PERSONA` turns.

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

See README.md to run an eval.
