"""Delete an env's workspace stop/start artifacts from the tier's storage bucket.

Stopped imbue_cloud workspaces live as encrypted objects in the tier's OVH
S3-compatible bucket (see docs/deploy/reference/workspace-stop-start.md). Per-env-Modal-env
tiers (dev / ci) share their tier's bucket under a per-env key prefix
(``<env>/``, stamped into the ``storage-<env>`` Modal secret at deploy);
shared tiers own the whole bucket. ``minds-admin env destroy`` uses this module
to reclaim exactly the keyspace the env's connector could have written,
so destroyed envs never orphan paid storage.
