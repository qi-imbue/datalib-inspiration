"""``minds-admin workspaces ...`` -- operator workspace-lifecycle escape hatches.

Authenticated with the fixed ``MINDS_ADMIN_KEY`` API key, like the paid-list
CRUD. ``abandon`` marks a workspace ``crashed`` -- the lever for a row whose
box is permanently dead and whose stop/start transition would otherwise
retry forever. The user recovers by restoring the workspace's backup into a
fresh workspace; artifacts and any surviving VM are reclaimed at release.
``release`` retires a confirmed-abandoned lease through the connector's own
release chain (artifacts, slice VM, workspace record, row), in any lifecycle
status -- the operator counterpart of the user's destroy.
