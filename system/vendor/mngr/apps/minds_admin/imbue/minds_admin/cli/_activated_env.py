"""Shared activation-check helpers for minds-admin CLI subcommands.

``minds-admin env deploy`` / ``destroy`` and the pool/server commands all
refuse to run unless the calling shell has been activated against a specific
minds env (``MINDS_ROOT_NAME`` set + matching the bootstrap pattern). The
check + error-message text is identical across the subcommands, so it lives
here rather than being duplicated.

``minds-admin env deploy`` / ``destroy`` / ``recover`` additionally require
*deploy-mode* activation (``minds-admin env activate --deploy``), which pins
``MODAL_PROFILE`` to the tier's Modal workspace. The deploy-mode gate also
lives here so all three commands share the same refusal text.

    read a different file than the subsequent ``modal …`` shellout
