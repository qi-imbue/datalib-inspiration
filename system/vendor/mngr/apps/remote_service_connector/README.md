# remote_service_connector

A lightweight service deployed as a Modal Function that connects minds clients to the remote services they need: Cloudflare tunnels, SuperTokens authentication, pool-host leasing, LiteLLM keys, R2 buckets, and per-account plans/quotas. All endpoints are authenticated, and every resource grant is checked against the account's entitlements (see "Plans and entitlements" below).

## What it does

Allows authenticated users to:
- Create Cloudflare tunnels (one per host running `cloudflared`)
- Add/remove forwarding rules (ingress + DNS) on those tunnels
- List their tunnels and configured services
- Delete tunnels (cascading cleanup of DNS and ingress)
- Lease pre-provisioned pool hosts, mint LiteLLM keys, and create R2 buckets
- See their plan, quotas, and live usage (and switch plans)
- Sign in / sign up via SuperTokens (proxying the SuperTokens core so clients never need its API key)

After creating a tunnel, users receive a token to run `cloudflared tunnel run --token <TOKEN>` on their host.

## Deployment

Deployment is split into two pieces so you can rotate secrets without redeploying code and vice versa.

### 1. Environment-scoped Modal secrets

The committed `.minds/template/*.sh` files declare the expected keys for each service -- they are the schema for the HCP Vault entries at `secrets/minds/<tier>/<service>`. To populate a fresh tier's Vault entry, copy the template into a tmp file, fill in the values, push it to Vault, and shred the local file:

```bash
cp .minds/template/cloudflare.sh /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
$EDITOR /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
uv run scripts/push_vault_from_file.py production cloudflare /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
shred -u /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
```

Each template file is shell-style:

```sh
# .minds/template/cloudflare.sh
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
# ...
```

Push everything to Modal and deploy in one shot:

```bash
eval "$(uv run minds env activate production)"
uv run minds env deploy --yes-i-mean-production
```

`minds env deploy` reads `apps/minds/imbue/minds/config/envs/production/deploy.toml`
for the list of services to push from Vault, creates/updates Modal
secrets named `<service>-<env>` (e.g. `cloudflare-production` and
`supertokens-production`), then runs `modal deploy` for both the
connector and the LiteLLM proxy. The push aborts with a diagnostic if
any Vault entry is missing a key declared by the template (empty
values are fine -- the deploy skips them when pushing to Modal).

**cloudflare.sh** holds the Cloudflare API credentials:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (required): API token with Tunnel Write and DNS Write permissions.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (required): Cloudflare account ID.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` (required): Cloudflare zone ID for DNS records.
- `CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN` (required): Base domain for service subdomains (e.g. `example.com`).
- `CLOUDFLARE_ALLOWED_IDPS` (optional): Comma-separated list of Cloudflare identity provider UUIDs allowed on Access Applications (e.g. Google OAuth, one-time PIN). When unset, Cloudflare uses the account default.

**supertokens.sh** holds the SuperTokens + OAuth credentials:

- `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` (required): URL of the SuperTokens core.
- `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY` (required for most deployments): SuperTokens core API key.
- `AUTH_WEBSITE_DOMAIN` (optional): Public base URL embedded in password-reset and email-verification links. Must match the URL Modal assigns to the deployed function. If unset, the app derives `https://{workspace}--remote-service-connector-<env>-fastapi-app.modal.run` (using the hardcoded default workspace in `app.py`), which is only correct for that specific Modal workspace -- set this explicitly for every deploy.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional): override Google OAuth client credentials. Leave blank to inherit from the SuperTokens core's dashboard.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional): override GitHub OAuth client credentials. Leave blank to inherit from the SuperTokens core's dashboard.
- `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` (optional): fixed API key authenticating the operator admin endpoints -- the paid-list CRUD (`/paid/*`), the account admin API (`/admin/accounts/*`), and the on-demand sweeps (`/admin/sweep/*`). Distinct from every other auth path -- the connector accepts it ONLY on those routes and rejects SuperTokens / tunnel tokens there, and rejects this key on every other route. Leave empty to disable the admin API. The `mngr imbue_cloud admin ...` CLI reads the same value from `$MINDS_ADMIN_KEY`. The deprecated `MINDS_PAID_ADMIN_KEY` spelling is still accepted (with a warning) while Vault entries and operator environments migrate.
- `MINDS_PAID_LIST_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (optional): how long (seconds) the connector caches a per-email paid-status lookup before re-querying the tables. Unset uses the built-in default (60s); `0` disables caching. Each container caches independently, so a paid-list change propagates within this window.

### Plans and entitlements (quotas)

Resource access is governed by per-account quotas ("entitlements"), not by a paid/unpaid gate:

- The `plans` table holds the plan definitions ("explorer" and "ally" today). It is **git-owned**: `minds env deploy` writes (overwriting) the `[plans]` blocks from the tier's `deploy.toml` after migrations, so deploy.toml is the source of truth for plan defaults.
- The `account_entitlements` table holds one row per account, created lazily on the account's first quota-relevant request. The row's values are copied wholesale from the plan at assignment and are the adjustable source of truth thereafter -- changing a plan's defaults never retroactively changes existing rows.
- Lazy-creation backfill rule: accounts whose SuperTokens `time_joined` predates the feature-ship cutoff get "ally" when their email is paid-listed; every newer account starts as "explorer".
- Quota rejections are HTTP 403 with structured detail: `{"code": "quota_exceeded", "entitlement": "<name>", "limit": N, "current": N, "message": "..."}`.
- Quotas are checked when a resource is *granted* (lease, tunnel, service, bucket, sync record, key). Lowering a quota below current usage never revokes existing resources; the two continuous exceptions are the monthly LLM budget (enforced per-request by LiteLLM user budgets) and R2 storage (enforced by the hourly sweep, see "R2 storage-quota sweep" below).

The quota entitlements: `max_remote_workspaces`, `max_tunnels`, `max_services_per_tunnel`, `max_buckets`, `max_total_bucket_bytes`, `monthly_llm_spend_usd`, `max_active_synced_workspaces`.

### Paid lists (ally-plan eligibility)

The paid lists remain, but only as the eligibility input for selecting the "ally" plan:

- `paid_emails` -- exact, full-email matches (e.g. `bob@gmail.com`).
- `paid_domains` -- exact domain matches on the part after `@` (e.g. `imbue.com` matches `alice@imbue.com` but NOT `alice@eng.imbue.com`).

An email is "paid-listed" when it (or its exact domain) has an active (`is_paid = true`) row in either table. Both tables are managed via the `/paid/*` CRUD endpoints (admin-key authenticated) or the `mngr imbue_cloud admin paid` CLI. Rows are never hard-deleted -- "remove" sets `is_paid = false`. Removing an email from the list does NOT automatically demote an existing ally; that is an operator action via the account admin API. The schema is created by `migrations/005_paid_lists.sql`.

On deploy, `minds env deploy` seeds each tier's configured default entries (the `[paid]` block in that tier's `deploy.toml`) into these tables right after migrations. Every tier currently defaults `domains = ["imbue.com"]`. Seeding is **seed-if-absent** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so it sets the initial default but never re-activates an entry an operator soft-removed.

### Cloudflare token requirements for R2

The R2 bucket routes require `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to be an **account-owned** token (`cfat_`) -- not a user-owned token (`cfut_`) -- because the connector mints account-owned per-bucket R2 tokens on the user's behalf. The token needs these permissions:

- `Cloudflare Tunnel: Edit`
- `DNS: Edit` (on the tier zone)
- `Access: Apps and Policies: Edit`
- `Access: Service Tokens: Edit`
- `Workers KV Storage: Edit`
- `Workers R2 Storage: Edit` (R2 buckets)
- `Account API Tokens: Edit` (mint/revoke/roll per-bucket R2 keys)
- `Account Analytics: Read` (the storage-quota sweep's GraphQL usage query)

**R2 must also be enabled on the Cloudflare account** (a one-time dashboard action; until then the API returns `code 10042 "Please enable R2 through the Cloudflare Dashboard"`). Existing tiers shipped with a user-owned tunnel/DNS token and must be migrated (create the account-owned token with the permissions above, replace `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in Vault, then redeploy) before the bucket routes work.

### 2. Deploy the Modal app

The previous step (`minds env deploy --yes-i-mean-production`) already
runs `modal deploy` for the connector as part of the unified deploy
flow. If you want to re-deploy just the connector (e.g. after editing
`app.py` without changing any Vault secrets), invoke `modal deploy`
directly:

```bash
MNGR_DEPLOY_ENV=production uv run modal deploy --name remote-service-connector-production \
    --env main apps/remote_service_connector/imbue/remote_service_connector/app.py
```

`MNGR_DEPLOY_ENV` is read at module load by `app.py` to pin the
secret names (`cloudflare-production`, `supertokens-production`).
Running `modal deploy` directly without the wrapper defaults to
`production`.

## Authentication

All non-`/auth/*` endpoints require a Bearer token:

- **Agent (tunnel token)**: `Authorization: Bearer <tunnel_token>` — scoped to a single tunnel. Can add/remove/list services on that tunnel only; cannot create/delete tunnels or manage auth policies.
- **User (SuperTokens JWT)**: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` — the signed-in user's SuperTokens session. A signed-in user has full authority over their own resources; their user-id prefix (the first 16 hex chars of their SuperTokens user ID) namespaces their tunnels, leases, and buckets.

The `/auth/*` endpoints are themselves the authentication flow, so they do not require a token.

### Quota enforcement

Every resource-granting endpoint checks the caller's entitlements (see "Plans and entitlements" above) on top of user auth:

- `POST /hosts/lease` -- `max_remote_workspaces` (strict: a per-user advisory lock serializes concurrent leases; stopped workspaces still hold their lease and count).
- `POST /tunnels` -- `max_tunnels` (idempotent re-creates of an existing tunnel are always allowed).
- `POST /tunnels/{name}/services` -- `max_services_per_tunnel` (re-adding an existing service is always allowed; enforced under both user and tunnel-token auth).
- `POST /buckets` -- `max_buckets`, plus `max_total_bucket_bytes` against live REST-measured usage (an account already over its storage quota cannot create new buckets; an unreadable usage number fails open). New keys minted while the owner is enforced-over-quota (bucket creation and roll-key's fresh mint) come out read-only with the downgrade recorded, so a fresh mint can never bypass the sweep.
- `POST /keys/create` -- refused outright when `monthly_llm_spend_usd` is 0 (e.g. the explorer plan); otherwise the account's LiteLLM user-level budget is upserted before minting, so LiteLLM caps aggregate spend across all the account's keys.
- `PUT /sync/records/{host_id}` -- `max_active_synced_workspaces` when the push would create a new ACTIVE record.

### Paid-list admin API (`/paid/*`)

The paid lists are managed by a separate set of endpoints authenticated by the fixed `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` (passed as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`). This key is rejected on all other routes, and SuperTokens / tunnel tokens are rejected here. All operations are idempotent; `list` returns every row with its `is_paid` status by default (`?paid_only=true` filters to active rows):

- `GET /paid/domains` / `GET /paid/emails` -- list rows.
- `POST /paid/domains/add` / `POST /paid/emails/add` -- body `{"value": "..."}`; add or reactivate.
- `POST /paid/domains/remove` / `POST /paid/emails/remove` -- body `{"value": "..."}`; soft-delete (`is_paid = false`).

## Identity providers for Access Applications

When `CLOUDFLARE_ALLOWED_IDPS` is set, Access Applications created for forwarded services will restrict authentication to the specified identity providers (e.g. Google OAuth, one-time PIN). This controls how end users authenticate when visiting a tunneled service URL. Set it to a comma-separated list of Cloudflare identity provider UUIDs. You can find these UUIDs in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard under Settings > Authentication.

## API

### Tunnels (signed-in user only)

- `POST /tunnels` -- Create a tunnel. Body: `{"agent_id": "...", "default_auth_policy": ...}`. Returns tunnel info with token.
- `GET /tunnels` -- List your tunnels with their configured services.
- `GET /tunnels/by-agent/{agent_id}` -- Resolve your tunnel for a single agent (O(1)): looks the tunnel up by its exact name (`<user_id_prefix>--<agent-prefix>`) via Cloudflare's server-side name filter plus one config fetch, instead of enumerating every tunnel like `GET /tunnels`. Returns the tunnel info (no token), or HTTP 200 with `null` when no tunnel exists for that agent yet. 404 is reserved for "this connector predates the endpoint" (an unknown route), which lets clients that are newer than the connector fall back to enumerating `GET /tunnels`.
- `DELETE /tunnels/{tunnel_name}` -- Delete a tunnel and all its DNS records, Access Applications, ingress rules, and KV entries.
- `POST /sharing/enable` -- Enable (or update) sharing for one service in a single call. Body: `{"agent_id": "...", "service_name": "...", "service_url": "...", "auth_policy": {...}}`. Ensures the tunnel (idempotent), adds the service, and applies the Access policy directly to its Access Application (replacing a pre-existing app's policies on re-enable). Returns `{"tunnel": {...with token}, "service": {...}}` so the caller needs no follow-up reads. Enforces the same `max_tunnels` / `max_services_per_tunnel` quotas as the individual endpoints.

### Services (user or tunnel token)

- `POST /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/services` -- Add a service. Body: `{"service_name": "...", "service_url": "http://localhost:8080"}`.
- `GET /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/services` -- List services on a tunnel.
- `DELETE /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/services/{service_name}` -- Remove a service, its DNS record, and its Access Application.

### Auth policies (signed-in user only)

- `GET /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/auth` -- Get the default auth policy for a tunnel (stored in Workers KV).
- `PUT /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/auth` -- Set the default auth policy for a tunnel. New services inherit this policy.
- `GET /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/services/{service_name}/auth` -- Get the auth policy for a specific service.
- `PUT /tunnels/{tunnel_name}/services/{service_name}/auth` -- Set/override the auth policy for a specific service.

Every forwarded service gets a Cloudflare Access Application, unconditionally:

- A tunnel created without an explicit default auth policy gets an allow-only-the-owner's-verified-email default.
- Adding a service creates its Access Application (with the tunnel default, or the owner-email fallback) *before* any DNS/ingress exists; if the Access step fails, the add is aborted and rolled back rather than leaving the service publicly reachable.
- Auth-policy writes reject policies with no identity constraint (every rule must name emails, email domains, an IdP login method, or a group). Access service tokens remain supported via the dedicated service-token endpoints.
- Per-service overrides replace the inherited policy entirely.

### Buckets (signed-in user only)

R2 buckets give an account remote object storage. Each bucket is isolated (one per host the user makes); isolation is per-bucket, not per-prefix. Buckets are named `<user_id_prefix>--<slug>` where `user_id_prefix` is the caller's 16-hex SuperTokens prefix; the server re-checks that prefix in code (not just via the R2 `name_contains` filter) so a crafted name cannot grant cross-user access. Each bucket has exactly **one** key; the hourly sweep revokes any extras (newest wins).

- `POST /buckets` -- Create a bucket and mint its single key. Body: `{"name": "...", "access": "read"|"readwrite"}`. Returns `{bucket, key}` where `key` includes the one-time `secret_access_key`. Errors `409` if the derived bucket already exists, `403` (quota) at the `max_buckets` cap, `400` on an invalid derived name.
- `GET /buckets` -- List the caller's buckets.
- `GET /buckets/{name}` -- Bucket metadata (full R2 name + S3 endpoint). Keys come from the key routes.
- `DELETE /buckets/{name}` -- Destroy a bucket. Returns `409` if the bucket is not empty (empty it first); on success, cascades -- revokes all of the bucket's keys and deletes their rows.
- `POST /buckets/{name}/roll-key` -- Return fresh credentials for the bucket's key by rolling its secret in place: same Access Key ID, new Secret Access Key, token policies untouched (so a storage-quota downgrade survives a roll). Mints a fresh key when the bucket has none.
- `GET /buckets/{name}/keys` -- List the caller's keys for one bucket (no secrets).
- `GET /bucket-keys` -- List all of the caller's keys across every bucket (no secrets).
- `DELETE /bucket-keys/{access_key_id}` -- Revoke a key by its Access Key ID and drop its row (recover with roll-key, which then mints anew).

Each key is an account-owned Cloudflare API token scoped to the one bucket; the S3 Access Key ID is the token id and the Secret Access Key is the SHA-256 of the token value (returned once, never stored). Only key *metadata* (access key id, owner, bucket, scope, alias, created_at, enforcement state) is persisted, in the `r2_keys` table; buckets themselves are listed straight from the R2 API.

### R2 storage-quota sweep

An hourly cron (`r2_quota_sweep`) enforces each account's `max_total_bucket_bytes`:

- Usage comes from one Cloudflare GraphQL analytics query per sweep (`r2StorageAdaptiveGroups`, grouped by `bucketName` only, so it returns exactly one row per bucket: the peak snapshot inside a 3-hour lookback). One query covers every bucket, so the sweep's API cost does not scale with bucket count; a response that fills the row budget (possible truncation) fails the cron run loudly instead of enforcing from partial data. The real-time per-bucket REST usage endpoint serves the display path (`GET /account`).
- The GraphQL peak is only a screening filter: before any key is downgraded, the owner is re-measured with the real-time REST usage endpoint (the same source the recheck endpoint reads), so a user who just cleaned up is never re-downgraded on a stale window peak. Restores need no confirmation -- a peak under the limit proves live usage is under it.
- An over-quota account's readwrite keys have their token policies flipped to read-only **in place** -- the S3 credentials are unchanged, so reads keep working while writes fail -- and are restored automatically once the account is back under quota.
- The sweep skips accounts with an active cleanup grant (see below), settles expired grants, and enforces the single-key-per-bucket invariant on every pass.
- `POST /admin/sweep/r2` (admin-key authenticated, like `/admin/accounts/*`) runs one sweep pass on demand; an optional `?email=` query parameter scopes it to a single account. Used operationally and by the deployment tests.

### Storage-cleanup grants

Cloudflare's R2 token model has no delete-without-write permission, and restic's space reclaim (`forget` + `prune`) needs full write access (prune repacks data). So an over-quota account with read-only keys could never reduce its own usage. Cleanup grants close that loop:

- `POST /account/storage-cleanup-grant` (SuperTokens auth) flips all of the caller's downgraded keys back to readwrite and records a grant with the live usage as its baseline. Idempotent: an active grant is returned as-is, and an account with nothing downgraded gets a `not_needed` no-op.
- `POST /account/storage-recheck` re-measures live usage and applies enforcement immediately (restoring or downgrading), settling any outstanding grant. It also works standalone -- a user who freed space some other way does not wait for the hourly sweep.
- A grant settles as *successful* when usage decreased at all versus its baseline. Only unsuccessful grants count against a rolling budget (5 settled-without-decrease grants per 24 hours; a 403 with `code: cleanup_grant_budget_exhausted` past that), so genuine cleanup is unlimited while write-under-cover-of-cleanup abuse is bounded to roughly one sweep interval of writes per burned grant.
- Grants expire after 60 minutes; the sweep settles expired grants as the fallback when the client never rechecked, and skips enforcement for accounts whose grant is still active (a prune transiently *increases* usage while it repacks).

### Destroyed-workspace backup retention reaper

Destroyed workspaces' backups (bucket + workspace record) are retained for 30 days, then reaped. An hourly cron (`backup_retention_reap`) is the server-side backstop (minds' client-side reaper does the same work faster where a client runs; every step is idempotent so the two never conflict):

- Workspace-backup buckets are identified by name: the short name after the owner prefix is the workspace's host id (`host-<hex>`). `POST /buckets` reserves that shape (refused unless a workspace record with the host id exists for the caller), and `DELETE /buckets/{name}` refuses such a bucket while its workspace record is still ACTIVE (tombstone-first is enforced server-side).
- Records carry a server-stamped `destroyed_at` (set on the transition to `state = destroyed`, kept across destroyed-state updates, cleared on resurrection). Destroyed records older than the window lose their bucket first, then the row -- a failed or partial bucket delete leaves the row for the next pass.
- Workspace-backup buckets referenced by **no** record at all (orphans) age from a first-seen stamp in the `orphan_backup_buckets` table; the migration's stamp-on-first-sight semantics double as the rollout grace period for pre-existing leftovers.
- Emptying is bounded per pass (record + object budgets) and resumable, so one cron invocation never runs long; a partially-emptied bucket continues on the next pass and the deletion lands on the pass that finishes.
- `GET /policies/destroyed-workspace-backups` (public) serves the retention window to clients.
- `POST /admin/sweep/backup-retention` (admin-key authenticated) runs one reap pass on demand. `?dry_run=1` returns the candidate list (kind, ids, stamps) without deleting anything; `?window_seconds=<n>` overrides the window (admin-only; e.g. `0` lets a deployment test reap a fresh tombstone).

### Account (signed-in user only)

- `GET /account` -- The caller's plan, entitlement values, live usage, and the available plan names. Lazily creates the entitlements row on first touch.
- `POST /account/plan` -- Switch plans. Body: `{"plan": "..."}`. Resets the account's entitlements wholesale to the plan's defaults; re-selecting the current plan is a no-op (idempotent retries never wipe operator-granted bumps). Switching to "ally" requires a paid-listed email (403 with the reason otherwise).

### Account admin API (`/admin/accounts/*`)

Email-addressed operator management of per-account entitlements, authenticated by the same fixed `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` as the paid-list CRUD (and exposed as `mngr imbue_cloud admin account ...`):

- `GET /admin/accounts/{email}` -- One account's plan, entitlements, and live usage (lazily creates the row).
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/plan` -- Body `{"plan": "..."}`; always resets to the plan's defaults (the operator's way to wipe manual bumps; skips the ally eligibility check).
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/quota` -- Body `{"entitlement": "...", "value": N}`; bump a single entitlement.

### Auth

These endpoints front the SuperTokens core so that clients (e.g. the `minds` desktop client) never need the SuperTokens API key. They require `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` (and usually `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY`) to be configured on the server; otherwise they return 503. All of them are unauthenticated *except* `/auth/session/revoke`, which must be called with the caller's own access token (see below).

- `POST /auth/signup` -- Body: `{email, password}`. Returns status, user info, session tokens, and whether email verification is pending. Refused with status `ACCOUNT_EXISTS_WITH_OTHER_METHOD` when the email is already registered under a different login method (e.g. Google).
- `POST /auth/signin` -- Body: `{email, password}`. Returns status, user info, session tokens, and whether email verification is pending.
- `POST /auth/session/refresh` -- Body: `{refresh_token}`. Returns a new access/refresh token pair.
- `POST /auth/session/revoke` -- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Revokes every SuperTokens session for the caller's user. The user_id is derived from the access token, so an anonymous caller cannot revoke another user's sessions. Called on sign-out so that access/refresh tokens stored on the client's machine become useless even if copied off-box.
- `POST /auth/email/send-verification` -- Body: `{user_id, email}`. Resends the verification email.
- `POST /auth/email/is-verified` -- Body: `{user_id, email}`. Returns `{verified: bool}`.
- `GET /auth/verify-email?token=...` -- Renders an HTML result page. Used by the link inside verification emails.
- `POST /auth/password/forgot` -- Body: `{email}`. Always returns OK (to avoid account enumeration).
- `POST /auth/password/reset` -- Body: `{token, new_password}`. Consumes a reset token and sets a new password.
- `GET /auth/reset-password?token=...` -- Renders an HTML form. Used by the link inside password-reset emails.
- `POST /auth/oauth/authorize` -- Body: `{provider_id, callback_url}`. Returns the URL to redirect the user to.
- `POST /auth/oauth/callback` -- Body: `{provider_id, callback_url, query_params}`. Exchanges OAuth params for a session. Refused with status `ACCOUNT_EXISTS_WITH_OTHER_METHOD` (before any user is created) when the email already has a password or other-provider account.
- `GET /auth/users/{user_id}` -- Returns basic info about a user (email, login provider).
