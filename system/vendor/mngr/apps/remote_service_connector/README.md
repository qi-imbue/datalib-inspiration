# remote_service_connector

A lightweight service deployed as a Modal Function that connects minds clients to the remote services they need: SuperTokens authentication, pool-host leasing, LiteLLM keys, R2 buckets, self-hosted workspace sharing, and per-account plans/quotas. All endpoints are authenticated, and every resource grant is checked against the account's entitlements (see "Plans and entitlements" below).

## What it does

Allows authenticated users to:
- Lease pre-provisioned pool hosts, mint LiteLLM keys, and create R2 buckets
- Share workspaces via the self-hosted relay design (`/shares/*`): share records + relay tokens, frps plugin authorization, ACME DNS-01 certificate issuance, and the accounts broker for share login handoff
- See their plan, quotas, and live usage (and switch plans)
- Sign in / sign up via SuperTokens (proxying the SuperTokens core so clients never need its API key)

## Code layout

The service lives in `imbue/remote_service_connector/`:

- `app.py` -- the Modal deployment entrypoint, and nothing else: image, `modal.App`, secrets, function definitions (web app + crons). Deployed by file path; the shipped modules may never import it.
- `web.py` -- FastAPI assembly (mounts every feature router) plus the unauthenticated system endpoints (`/health/liveness`, `/generation`, `/version`).
- Feature modules, each an `APIRouter`: `shares.py` (share records, relay tokens, frps plugin auth), `share_certs.py` (ACME DNS-01 issuance), `share_broker.py` (the accounts broker), `hosts.py`, `llm_keys.py`, `accounts.py`, `sync.py`, `retention.py`, `lease_records.py`, `auth_proxy.py`, and the `r2/` subpackage (`naming`, `stores`, `buckets`, `grants`, `sweep`).
- Foundation modules: `auth.py`, `entitlements.py`, `litellm_client.py`, `cloudflare.py` (raw R2 API client + the shared `CloudflareCtx`), `http_api.py`, `db.py`, `errors.py`, `attribution.py` (the `imbue_attribution` marketing-cookie parser plus the fail-open signup-attribution and download-event writers; see "Download redirect and marketing attribution"), `deploy_constants.py` (the image's pip set).

The container receives only these modules plus three other mounted packages: `imbue.modal_app_kit` (the deploy conventions), `imbue.mngr_imbue_cloud.slices.gen2_scripts` (the gen-2 slice layout, sizing math, cloud-init material, and box-side transfer/restore/resize script renderers the workspace stop/start supervisor shares with the imbue_cloud plugin and the operator tooling -- `box_scripts_gen2.py` keeps only the connector's own lifecycle command sequences and the upload script), and `imbue.imbue_common` (the frozen-model base those renderers use; only its stdlib/pydantic-only modules may be reached, since its logging and secret modules need packages the image lacks). Nothing else from the monorepo exists at runtime, so shipped modules must not import anything else from it. The rules (and why they exist) are documented in [libs/modal_app_kit/README.md](../../libs/modal_app_kit/README.md) and enforced by `test_project_ratchets.py`, whose import walk follows imports into the mounted packages transitively.

## Deployment

Deployment is split into two pieces so you can rotate secrets without redeploying code and vice versa.

### 1. Environment-scoped Modal secrets

The committed `.minds/template/*.sh` files declare the expected keys for each service -- they are the schema for the HCP Vault entries at `secrets/minds/<tier>/<service>`. To populate a fresh tier's Vault entry, copy the template into a tmp file, fill in the values, push it to Vault, and shred the local file:

```bash
cp .minds/template/cloudflare.sh /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
$EDITOR /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
uv run scripts/push_vault_from_file.py production cloudflare /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
shred -u /tmp/cloudflare-production.sh
```

Each template file is shell-style:

```sh
# .minds/template/cloudflare.sh
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
# ...
```

Push everything to Modal and deploy in one shot:

```bash
eval "$(uv run minds-admin env activate production)"
uv run minds-admin env deploy --yes-i-mean-production
```

`minds-admin env deploy` reads `apps/minds/imbue/minds/config/envs/production/deploy.toml`
for the list of services to push from Vault, creates/updates Modal
secrets named `<service>-<env>` (e.g. `cloudflare-production` and
`supertokens-production`), then runs `modal deploy` for the
connector and the LiteLLM proxy. The push aborts with a diagnostic if
any Vault entry is missing a key declared by the template (empty
values are fine -- the deploy skips them when pushing to Modal).

The connector reports errors to the tier's self-hosted Bugsink instance
(an operator-lifecycle VPS, provisioned via `apps/observability`) through
`imbue.modal_app_kit.sentry` -- a no-op until the tier's `sentry`
Vault entry carries `RSC_SENTRY_DSN`, and disabled entirely by
`MINDS_SENTRY_DISABLED=1` (see `specs/minds-bugsink-error-tracking.md`).
The reporting policy:

- Every connector-defined exception inherits `errors.ConnectorError`; the
  EXPECTED ones are exactly those `http_api.raise_as_http` maps to status
  codes. Anything else escaping a route reaches the app-level 500 handler
  (`http_api.handle_unexpected_exception`), which reports it at error
  (top) priority and answers `{"detail": {"code": "internal_error",
  "message": ..., "event_id": ...}}` -- the exception text itself is
  included only on dev/ci tiers, never on production/staging.
- `logger.error` and `logger.warning` both become Bugsink events; warning
  is the lower-priority channel for exceptions the code caught and
  continued past for robustness. Expected, routine anomalies (transient
  upstream errors, client-input junk) are instead counted as `metric`
  JSON log lines (`imbue.modal_app_kit.metrics`) that flow into the
  tier's OpenObserve via Modal's OTEL integration, so their rates are
  chartable without polluting the error tracker.
- Cron/spawned Modal functions report through `capture_and_reraise`.
- Every log line the container emits is one JSON object with an explicit
  `level` (`imbue.modal_app_kit.log_format`, installed by `configure_logging`
  at the top of each Modal function): Modal's OTEL exporter stamps every
  line `INFO`, so severity queries over `modal_logs` use
  `spath(body, 'level')`. Our `imbue.*` loggers emit at INFO
  (raise a dev env with `MINDS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` at deploy time); third-party
  libraries stay at WARNING.
- `GET /health/reporting-probe` (dev/ci tiers only; disabled on
  production/staging) deliberately exercises every channel in one request
  -- a metric line, a warning event, and an unmapped exception through the
  500 handler -- so the deployment-test suite can prove the pipeline end
  to end (`apps/minds/deployment_tests/test_error_reporting.py`).

**cloudflare.sh** holds the Cloudflare API credentials (R2 buckets + ACME DNS-01 TXT records; the tunnel/Access stack is gone):

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (required): account-owned API token; see "Cloudflare token requirements for R2" below.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (required): Cloudflare account ID.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` (required): Cloudflare zone ID (used for the ACME DNS-01 challenge TXT records).
- `CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN` (required): Base domain for the tier's DNS records (read by the tier setup scripts, not by the connector).

**supertokens.sh** holds the SuperTokens + OAuth credentials:

- `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` (required): URL of the SuperTokens core.
- `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY` (required for most deployments): SuperTokens core API key.
- `AUTH_WEBSITE_DOMAIN` (required whenever `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` is set): Public base URL embedded in password-reset and email-verification links. Must match the URL Modal assigns to the deployed function. There is no derived fallback: if unset, `init_supertokens()` raises `MissingAuthWebsiteDomainError` at container startup, so populate it in the per-tier `supertokens-<env>-<deploy-id>` Modal secret (the deploy script pushes it from the tier's Vault entry).
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional): override Google OAuth client credentials. Leave blank to inherit from the SuperTokens core's dashboard.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional): override GitHub OAuth client credentials. Leave blank to inherit from the SuperTokens core's dashboard.
- `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` (optional): fixed API key authenticating the operator admin endpoints -- the paid-list CRUD (`/paid/*`), the account admin API (`/admin/accounts/*`), and the on-demand sweeps (`/admin/sweep/*`). Distinct from every other auth path -- the connector accepts it ONLY on those routes and rejects SuperTokens tokens there, and rejects this key on every other route. Leave empty to disable the admin API. The `minds-admin ...` CLI reads the same value from `$MINDS_ADMIN_KEY`. The deprecated `MINDS_PAID_ADMIN_KEY` spelling is still accepted (with a warning) while Vault entries and operator environments migrate.
- `MINDS_PAID_LIST_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (optional): how long (seconds) the connector caches a per-email paid-status lookup before re-querying the tables. Unset uses the built-in default (60s); `0` disables caching. Each container caches independently, so a paid-list change propagates within this window.

### Plans and entitlements (quotas)

Resource access is governed by per-account quotas ("entitlements"), not by a paid/unpaid gate:

- The `plans` table holds the plan definitions ("free", "explorer", and "ally" today). It is **git-owned**: `minds-admin env deploy` writes (overwriting) the `[plans]` blocks from the tier's `deploy.toml` after migrations, so deploy.toml is the source of truth for plan defaults.
- The `account_entitlements` table holds one row per account, created lazily on the account's first quota-relevant request. The row's values are copied wholesale from the plan at assignment and are the adjustable source of truth thereafter -- changing a plan's defaults never retroactively changes existing rows.
- The hosted signup form offers "free" and "explorer" (explorer recommended and preselected); the chosen plan's row is created at account creation, on both the password and Google paths (the choice rides the OAuth state JWT). The write fails open: a lost choice degrades to the lazy backfill below.
- Lazy-creation backfill rule: accounts whose SuperTokens `time_joined` predates the feature-ship cutoff get "ally" when their email is paid-listed; every other account without a recorded signup choice backfills as "free". Explorer-plan membership is the in-workspace analytics-collection consent (see `specs/minds-analytics/spec.md`), so it is only ever assigned by an explicit user choice -- the signup selector or a later plan switch -- never by a fallback.
- Account creation also requires agreeing to the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct. The signup form gates both creation paths client-side; for Google, the agreement rides the OAuth state, and a new-account exchange arriving without it (the sign-in tab's button) is rolled back and bounced to the login page's `terms_required` banner. The linked documents are static HTML pages shipped in the accounts bundle and served at `/terms-of-service`, `/code-of-conduct`, and `/privacy-policy` (the plan selector's "Learn more" target).
- Quota rejections are HTTP 403 with structured detail: `{"code": "quota_exceeded", "entitlement": "<name>", "limit": N, "current": N, "message": "..."}`.
- Quotas are checked when a resource is *granted* (lease, bucket, sync record, key, share). Lowering a quota below current usage never revokes existing resources; the two continuous exceptions are the monthly LLM budget (enforced per-request by LiteLLM user budgets) and R2 storage (enforced by the hourly sweep, see "R2 storage-quota sweep" below).

The quota entitlements: `max_remote_workspaces`, `max_buckets`, `max_total_bucket_bytes`, `monthly_llm_spend_usd`, `max_active_synced_workspaces`.

### Paid lists (ally-plan eligibility)

The paid lists remain, but only as the eligibility input for selecting the "ally" plan:

- `paid_emails` -- exact, full-email matches (e.g. `bob@gmail.com`).
- `paid_domains` -- exact domain matches on the part after `@` (e.g. `imbue.com` matches `alice@imbue.com` but NOT `alice@eng.imbue.com`).

An email is "paid-listed" when it (or its exact domain) has an active (`is_paid = true`) row in either table. Both tables are managed via the `/paid/*` CRUD endpoints (admin-key authenticated) or the `minds-admin paid` CLI. Rows are never hard-deleted -- "remove" sets `is_paid = false`. Removing an email from the list does NOT automatically demote an existing ally; that is an operator action via the account admin API. The schema is created by `migrations/005_paid_lists.sql`.

On deploy, `minds-admin env deploy` seeds each tier's configured default entries (the `[paid]` block in that tier's `deploy.toml`) into these tables right after migrations. Every tier currently defaults `domains = ["imbue.com"]`. Seeding is **seed-if-absent** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so it sets the initial default but never re-activates an entry an operator soft-removed.

### Cloudflare token requirements for R2

The R2 bucket routes require `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to be an **account-owned** token (`cfat_`) -- not a user-owned token (`cfut_`) -- because the connector mints account-owned per-bucket R2 tokens on the user's behalf. The token needs these permissions:

- `DNS: Edit` (on the tier zone; ACME DNS-01 challenge TXT records for shared-workspace certificates)
- `Workers R2 Storage: Edit` (R2 buckets)
- `Account API Tokens: Edit` (mint/revoke/roll per-bucket R2 keys)
- `Account Analytics: Read` (the storage-quota sweep's GraphQL usage query)

**R2 must also be enabled on the Cloudflare account** (a one-time dashboard action; until then the API returns `code 10042 "Please enable R2 through the Cloudflare Dashboard"`). Existing tiers shipped with a user-owned DNS token and must be migrated (create the account-owned token with the permissions above, replace `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in Vault, then redeploy) before the bucket routes work.

### 2. Deploy the Modal app

The previous step (`minds-admin env deploy --yes-i-mean-production`) already
runs `modal deploy` for the connector as part of the unified deploy
flow. If you want to re-deploy just the connector (e.g. after editing
`app.py` without changing any Vault secrets), invoke `modal deploy`
directly:

```bash
MNGR_DEPLOY_ENV=production uv run modal deploy --name remote-service-connector-production \
    --env main apps/remote_service_connector/imbue/remote_service_connector/app.py
```

`MNGR_DEPLOY_ENV` is read at module load by `app.py` to pin the
secret names (`cloudflare-production`, `supertokens-production`).
Running `modal deploy` directly without the wrapper defaults to
`production`.

## Authentication

All non-`/auth/*` endpoints require a Bearer token, with the exceptions noted below:

- **User (SuperTokens JWT)**: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` — the signed-in user's SuperTokens session. A signed-in user has full authority over their own resources; their user-id prefix (the first 16 hex chars of their SuperTokens user ID) namespaces their leases and buckets.
- **Email verification is non-blocking**: an unverified account authenticates like any other. A verified email is required only for the actions where the email is an authorization identity (the `require_verified_email` guard: satisfying a share grant as a visitor via the accounts broker, and ally-plan eligibility -- the explicit plan switch and the lazy pre-cutoff backfill) plus, as a spam/abuse mitigation, creating a remote workspace (`POST /hosts/lease` and `POST /hosts/claim`). Gated endpoints return a structured 403 `{"code": "email_not_verified", ...}` so clients can prompt verification contextually; the workspace-creation gate additionally sends the verification email itself (cooldown-limited) and reports that in the detail's `sent` field. Nothing ever auto-marks an email verified (the old paid-list auto-verification is gone); the admin-key test-signup endpoint is the sole, operator-trust exception.
- The share-certificate endpoint (`POST /shares/cert`) is instead authenticated by the share's relay token (see `share_certs.py`), and the frps plugin callback by its shared secret (see `shares.py`).
- **Browser sessions (the hosted accounts surface)**: the `/login` / `/signup` / `/manage` pages and their `/accounts/api/*` JSON API use SuperTokens' native cookie-based sessions (the SDK middleware serves refresh under `/accounts/auth/`). Sessions roll via refresh but are capped at ~30 days from creation: a creation-time stamp in the access token payload (which survives refreshes) is checked on every resolution, and a session past the cap -- or without a readable stamp -- is revoked on sight. The cap lives in the connector because the SDK cannot configure the SuperTokens core's refresh-token validity. The device handoff (`GET /accounts/authorize` + `POST /auth/device/token`) mints independent bearer-token sessions for the desktop app / CLI; those are not subject to the browser-session cap (clients hold a refresh token and rotate it).
- The share-authorization route (`GET /share/authorize`) resolves the same browser session; `GET /share/jwks.json` is public (it serves only the broker's verification keys).
- The download redirect (`GET /download`) is public -- it serves the marketing site's download buttons (see "Download redirect and marketing attribution" below).

The `/auth/*` endpoints are themselves the authentication flow, so they do not require a token.

### Signup IP hardening

Account creation on the hosted accounts surface (the Turnstile-gated password form and the Google OAuth callback's new-account branch) is additionally gated on the client IP (`signup_hardening.py`); returning sign-ins are untouched. The trusted IP is the ASGI socket peer -- Modal's ingress delivers the real client there and strips `X-Forwarded-For`, while other forwarding-style headers pass through unsanitized and are never consulted (see `modal_app_kit`'s `client_ip_from_asgi_scope`).

- **Velocity limits**: per-IP (hourly) and per-subnet (/24 v4, /48 v6, daily) caps counted from the Neon `signup_attempts` table. Refusals answer status `RATE_LIMITED`.
- **Reputation bands** from the IPinfo Max lookup API (`IPINFO_TOKEN` in the supertokens secret; lookups are cached per IP in `ip_reputation_cache` and budget-capped per day), unioned with an hourly-refreshed Tor-exit-list check that needs no token: Tor/hosting IPs are blocked outright (`SIGNUP_BLOCKED`; a Google-created account is rolled back), and vpn/proxy/relay IPs (residential proxies included, on the IPinfo Max plan) are stepped up to OAuth-only (`OAUTH_ONLY` -- the password form is refused, Continue with Google still works).
- **Fail-open everywhere** (deliberately the opposite of Turnstile, which fails closed): a Neon, IPinfo, or Tor-list outage degrades signup to "Turnstile + whatever signal remains" with a warning log.
- **Every gated attempt is recorded** (allowed ones included) with its IP, subnet, verdict, and outcome in `signup_attempts`, so a flood is visible in real time rather than reconstructed from Modal logs afterwards.
- Enforcement applies on the tiers whose signup is restricted to the hosted surface (production/staging, the same line as the JSON-signup refusal); dev/CI tiers record verdicts but never refuse.

### Quota enforcement

Every resource-granting endpoint checks the caller's entitlements (see "Plans and entitlements" above) on top of user auth:

- `POST /hosts/lease` -- `max_remote_workspaces` (strict: a per-user advisory lock serializes concurrent leases; stopped workspaces still hold their lease and count). Also requires a verified email, like `POST /hosts/claim` (see "Email verification is non-blocking" above).
- `POST /buckets` -- `max_buckets`, plus `max_total_bucket_bytes` against live REST-measured usage (an account already over its storage quota cannot create new buckets; an unreadable usage number fails open). New keys minted while the owner is enforced-over-quota (bucket creation and roll-key's fresh mint) come out read-only with the downgrade recorded, so a fresh mint can never bypass the sweep.
- `POST /keys/create` -- refused outright when `monthly_llm_spend_usd` is 0 (e.g. the free and explorer plans); otherwise the account's LiteLLM user-level budget is upserted before minting, so LiteLLM caps aggregate spend across all the account's keys.
- `PUT /sync/records/by-workspace/{workspace_id}` (and the deprecated host-keyed shim `PUT /sync/records/{host_id}`) -- `max_active_synced_workspaces` when the push would create a new ACTIVE record.

### Paid-list admin API (`/paid/*`)

The paid lists are managed by a separate set of endpoints authenticated by the fixed `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` (passed as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`). This key is rejected on all other routes, and SuperTokens tokens are rejected here. All operations are idempotent; `list` returns every row with its `is_paid` status by default (`?paid_only=true` filters to active rows):

- `GET /paid/domains` / `GET /paid/emails` -- list rows.
- `POST /paid/domains/add` / `POST /paid/emails/add` -- body `{"value": "..."}`; add or reactivate.
- `POST /paid/domains/remove` / `POST /paid/emails/remove` -- body `{"value": "..."}`; soft-delete (`is_paid = false`).

## API

### Shares (signed-in user; self-hosted workspace sharing)

A shared workspace lives at `<service>.<share-label>.<user-hash>.<region>.<content-domain>` behind a self-hosted frps relay (the share label is minted and persisted on the share row; the user hash is one-way so certificate-transparency logs never reveal the account id). Shares created by clients that predate workspace-keyed sharing keep their legacy `<service>.<host-id>.<user-label>.<region>.<content-domain>` domains -- a re-share never changes an existing share's domain. The connector owns the share records, relay tokens, and certificate issuance:

- `POST /shares` -- Enable sharing for one workspace. Body: `{"host_id": "host-<32hex>", "workspace_id": "agent-<32hex>"}` (`workspace_id` -- the workspace's durable identity -- keys the share so it follows the workspace across machines; old clients may omit it and get a legacy host-id-led domain), plus an optional `preferred_region` (honored only for hosts the connector has no datacenter record of, e.g. local workspaces; a re-share always keeps the share's existing region). Returns the workspace domain, the relay endpoint the workspace's frpc should dial, and the plaintext relay token (returned exactly once; only its hash is stored). Re-sharing rotates the token.
- `GET /shares` -- List the caller's share records (active and inactive).
- `GET /shares/relays` -- The region -> relay tunnel-control endpoint map plus the default region, so clients can pick a `preferred_region` by measuring their own latency.
- `DELETE /shares/{host_id}` -- Disable sharing (share goes `inactive`, relay token deleted).
- `POST /hosts/{host_db_id}/enable-sharing` -- The web chrome's server-side bring-up for one of the caller's leased hosts: creates/rotates the share record, then writes the share materials into the container over SSH pinned to the row's recorded container host key. A workspace the minds desktop app adopted serves a rotated host key the connector never learns, so the route (which handshakes with the container before touching the share, so a refusal never rotates a token the desktop's own share is running on) answers `409 {"code": "workspace_managed_by_desktop", ...}`: enable sharing from the desktop app instead.
- `GET /shares/{host_id}/status` -- One share's domain, tunnel-liveness signal, certificate expiry, and the chrome's entry label.
- `POST /shares/cert` -- Sign the workspace's CSR via ACME DNS-01 (authenticated by the share's relay token; the workspace keeps its private key).
- `POST /frps/auth/{relay_id}` -- The frps server-plugin callback authorizing relay `Login` / `NewProxy` / `Ping` operations, authenticated by the shared plugin secret delivered as an `Authorization: Basic` header (the relay's rendered plugin `addr` carries it as URL userinfo, so it never lands in access-logged paths; `FRPS_AUTH_SECRET` accepts a comma-separated set so rotations can briefly accept old + new). The legacy path-secret shape `POST /frps/auth/{plugin_secret}/{relay_id}` is still accepted while pre-rollout relays remain deployed (its structured access-log lines carry a redacted path). An allowed `NewProxy` also records the workspace's shell-service label as the share's chrome entry origin (the connector never reads anything from inside the workspace). A `Ping` (the workspace's ~10s heartbeat) is rejected when its relay token no longer resolves to an active share -- severing the LIVE tunnel of a suspended or freshly unshared workspace -- and fails open on connector-internal errors so tunnel uptime is coupled only to the connector being reachable. Allowed Ping decisions are cached in-process for `MINDS_FRPS_PING_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30s, `0` disables), so the sever takes effect within one heartbeat interval plus at most that TTL; rejects and fail-opens are never cached, and `Login`/`NewProxy` always hit the DB. Successful pings emit no per-request access-log line; their rate and duration flow into OpenObserve as periodic `frps_ping_authorized` / `frps_ping_authorized_duration_ms_total` metric records per relay (rejected and errored pings still log in full).
- `GET /share/authorize`, `GET /share/jwks.json` -- the accounts broker: authorizes a visit to a shared workspace against the hosted accounts surface's browser session and mints the short-lived handoff JWT (`GET /share/login` survives only as a permanent redirect to the merged `/login` page).

### Web workspace creation (signed-in browser session)

- `POST /hosts/claim` -- The hosted web chrome's create primitive: lease a pool host baked at the pinned template tag (fast path only, no rebuild fallback), adopt it over management SSH, start its agent, and bring sharing up so it is reachable from the browser the moment the call returns. Body: `{ssh_public_key, host_name, display_name?, region?, channel?}`. The template tag comes from the release feed: `channel` (the web user's choice in the chrome's Settings; unset or unknown means `stable`) selects `<channel>-web.json` on the tier's update feed (`MINDS_UPDATE_FEED_BASE_URL`, published from `[web_channels.*]` in `apps/minds/release-channels.toml`), read on every claim and cached about a minute per channel (`web_template_channel.py`). When the tier has no feed, the channel file is unpublished, or the feed cannot be read, the deploy-time `MINDS_WEB_TEMPLATE_REF` pin is used instead. The repo (`MINDS_WEB_TEMPLATE_REPO`) and the blessed shape (`MINDS_WEB_SHAPE_*`) always come from the deploy. Refused with 503 when neither source names a tag (web creation disabled on the tier).

### Buckets (signed-in user only)

R2 buckets give an account remote object storage. Each bucket is isolated (one per host the user makes); isolation is per-bucket, not per-prefix. Buckets are named `<user_id_prefix>--<slug>` where `user_id_prefix` is the caller's 16-hex SuperTokens prefix; the server re-checks that prefix in code (not just via the R2 `name_contains` filter) so a crafted name cannot grant cross-user access. Each bucket has exactly **one** key; the hourly sweep revokes any extras (newest wins).

- `POST /buckets` -- Create a bucket and mint its single key. Body: `{"name": "...", "access": "read"|"readwrite"}`. Returns `{bucket, key}` where `key` includes the one-time `secret_access_key`. Errors `409` if the derived bucket already exists, `403` (quota) at the `max_buckets` cap, `400` on an invalid derived name.
- `GET /buckets` -- List the caller's buckets.
- `GET /buckets/{name}` -- Bucket metadata (full R2 name + S3 endpoint). Keys come from the key routes.
- `DELETE /buckets/{name}` -- Destroy a bucket. Returns `409` if the bucket is not empty (empty it first); on success, cascades -- revokes all of the bucket's keys and deletes their rows.
- `POST /buckets/{name}/roll-key` -- Return fresh credentials for the bucket's key by rolling its secret in place: same Access Key ID, new Secret Access Key, token policies untouched (so a storage-quota downgrade survives a roll). Mints a fresh key when the bucket has none.
- `GET /buckets/{name}/keys` -- List the caller's keys for one bucket (no secrets).
- `GET /bucket-keys` -- List all of the caller's keys across every bucket (no secrets).
- `DELETE /bucket-keys/{access_key_id}` -- Revoke a key by its Access Key ID and drop its row (recover with roll-key, which then mints anew).

Each key is an account-owned Cloudflare API token scoped to the one bucket; the S3 Access Key ID is the token id and the Secret Access Key is the SHA-256 of the token value (returned once, never stored). Only key *metadata* (access key id, owner, bucket, scope, alias, created_at, enforcement state) is persisted, in the `r2_keys` table; buckets themselves are listed straight from the R2 API.

### R2 storage-quota sweep

An hourly cron (`r2_quota_sweep`) enforces each account's `max_total_bucket_bytes`:

- Usage comes from one Cloudflare GraphQL analytics query per sweep (`r2StorageAdaptiveGroups`, grouped by `bucketName` only, so it returns exactly one row per bucket: the peak snapshot inside a 3-hour lookback). One query covers every bucket, so the sweep's API cost does not scale with bucket count; a response that fills the row budget (possible truncation) fails the cron run loudly instead of enforcing from partial data. The real-time per-bucket REST usage endpoint serves the display path (`GET /account`).
- The GraphQL peak is only a screening filter: before any key is downgraded, the owner is re-measured with the real-time REST usage endpoint (the same source the recheck endpoint reads), so a user who just cleaned up is never re-downgraded on a stale window peak. Restores need no confirmation -- a peak under the limit proves live usage is under it.
- An over-quota account's readwrite keys have their token policies flipped to read-only **in place** -- the S3 credentials are unchanged, so reads keep working while writes fail -- and are restored automatically once the account is back under quota.
- The sweep skips accounts with an active cleanup grant (see below), settles expired grants, and enforces the single-key-per-bucket invariant on every pass.
- `POST /admin/sweep/r2` (admin-key authenticated, like `/admin/accounts/*`) runs one sweep pass on demand; an optional `?email=` query parameter scopes it to a single account. Used operationally and by the deployment tests.

### Storage-cleanup grants

Cloudflare's R2 token model has no delete-without-write permission, and restic's space reclaim (`forget` + `prune`) needs full write access (prune repacks data). So an over-quota account with read-only keys could never reduce its own usage. Cleanup grants close that loop:

- `POST /account/storage-cleanup-grant` (SuperTokens auth) flips all of the caller's downgraded keys back to readwrite and records a grant with the live usage as its baseline. Idempotent: an active grant is returned as-is, and an account with nothing downgraded gets a `not_needed` no-op.
- `POST /account/storage-recheck` re-measures live usage and applies enforcement immediately (restoring or downgrading), settling any outstanding grant. It also works standalone -- a user who freed space some other way does not wait for the hourly sweep.
- A grant settles as *successful* when usage decreased at all versus its baseline. Only unsuccessful grants count against a rolling budget (5 settled-without-decrease grants per 24 hours; a 403 with `code: cleanup_grant_budget_exhausted` past that), so genuine cleanup is unlimited while write-under-cover-of-cleanup abuse is bounded to roughly one sweep interval of writes per burned grant.
- Grants expire after 60 minutes; the sweep settles expired grants as the fallback when the client never rechecked, and skips enforcement for accounts whose grant is still active (a prune transiently *increases* usage while it repacks).
- Enforcement flips are serialized per account by a DB lease; while another enforcement pass (sweep, grant, recheck, or suspension) holds the account's lease past a bounded wait, these two endpoints answer a retryable 503 with `code: enforcement_busy` (or `enforcement_interrupted` when a pass was taken over mid-run) -- the client simply retries shortly.

### Destroyed-workspace backup retention reaper

Destroyed workspaces' backups (bucket + workspace record) are retained for 30 days, then reaped. An hourly cron (`backup_retention_reap`) is the server-side backstop (minds' client-side reaper does the same work faster where a client runs; every step is idempotent so the two never conflict):

- Workspace-backup buckets are associated with their record primarily through the record's explicit `backup_bucket` column; name derivation is the legacy fallback. New buckets are named by the workspace id (`agent-<hex>`, the workspace's system-services agent id); buckets provisioned before the workspace-keyed naming carry the machine's host id (`host-<hex>`) and are grandfathered. Both short-name shapes are reserved: `POST /buckets` refuses them unless a workspace record backs the name for the caller, and `DELETE /buckets/{name}` refuses such a bucket while its workspace record is still ACTIVE (tombstone-first is enforced server-side).
- Records carry a server-stamped `destroyed_at` (set on the transition to `state = destroyed`, kept across destroyed-state updates, cleared on resurrection). Destroyed records older than the window lose their bucket first, then the row -- a failed or partial bucket delete leaves the row for the next pass.
- Workspace-backup buckets referenced by **no** record at all (orphans) age from a first-seen stamp in the `orphan_backup_buckets` table; the migration's stamp-on-first-sight semantics double as the rollout grace period for pre-existing leftovers.
- Emptying is bounded per pass (record + object budgets) and resumable, so one cron invocation never runs long; a partially-emptied bucket continues on the next pass and the deletion lands on the pass that finishes.
- `GET /policies/destroyed-workspace-backups` (public) serves the retention window to clients.
- `POST /admin/sweep/backup-retention` (admin-key authenticated) runs one reap pass on demand. `?dry_run=1` returns the candidate list (kind, ids, stamps) without deleting anything; `?window_seconds=<n>` overrides the window (admin-only; e.g. `0` lets a deployment test reap a fresh tombstone).

### Workspace stop kinds

Every stop of a workspace stamps `pool_hosts.stop_kind` with why it happened, and every start clears it (`specs/workspace-stop-kinds.md`): `owner` (the user's own stop, from any of their devices), `maintenance` (an operator hold, such as the gen-1 to gen-2 migration), `idle` (an operator stop to free capacity, such as `server drain`) or `suspension` (the suspend fan-out; the unsuspend fan-out rewrites those rows to `idle`). NULL is a stop recorded before the column existed and reads as `owner`. `GET /workspaces` and `GET /workspaces/{id}` carry the kind as `stop_kind`. The owner's `POST /workspaces/{id}/start` refuses `maintenance` and `suspension` rows from `stopping` onwards with `409 {"code": "workspace_under_maintenance", "message": "This machine is undergoing maintenance and will be back shortly."}` (the same detail the cutover's parked-row guard answers); the operator start ignores the kind, which is how a held workspace comes back.

### Workspace records and pool leases (the lease invariant)

A pool lease (`pool_hosts`) and a synced workspace record (`workspace_records`, see the `/sync/*` routes) are two views of one cloud workspace. Records are client-driven in general (their secrets blob is encrypted under a per-account key only clients hold), but the connector keeps the two views consistent at the points only it controls:

- `POST /hosts/lease` and `POST /hosts/claim` insert a metadata-only ACTIVE record stub (display name, `provider_kind = imbue_cloud_<account-slug>`, no secrets) **in the same transaction** as the lease grant, so a lease without a record never exists, even transiently. The owning desktop's reconcile enriches the stub through the normal CAS push (its first push conflicts on the stub's revision and rebases). Side effect: CLI-created workspaces appear in every signed-in client's list.
- `POST /hosts/{id}/release` (and the operator release, the failed-claim rollback, and the sweep below) retires the workspace's ACTIVE record in the same transaction as the row's flip to `removing`: a record a client has written to is tombstoned (`state = destroyed`, `destroyed_at` stamped, revision bumped), while a record still at its lease-time stub (revision 1, no secrets, no backup bucket -- a create or claim that failed after the lease, or a workspace with nothing to recover) is deleted outright so no ghost appears in "recently destroyed". Either way a `mngr destroy` from the CLI can no longer leave an ACTIVE record behind.
- **Tombstone-first**: `DELETE /sync/records/by-workspace/{workspace_id}` (and the host-keyed shim) answer `409 {"code": "lease_active"}` while the caller holds a pool lease for the workspace, in any lifecycle status (`leased`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `starting`, `crashed`, `removing`). Destroying the workspace is what releases the lease; "remove from list" cannot manufacture a lease no client shows. The backup-retention reaper honors the same rule: a tombstone whose lease still exists is never reaped, so the sweep's evidence survives the 30-day window.
- **The lease-vs-record sweep** (`lease_record_sweep`, hourly at :20; `POST /admin/sweep/lease-records` on demand, `?dry_run=1` to list verdicts, `?grace_seconds=<n>` to override the window) joins every lease-holding row against its owner's record. A lease whose record is a tombstone older than the 6-hour grace window is released through the exact release chain above (the user's destroy intent is durable and the release evidently failed); a row still `removing` past the same window (its flip is the same kind of durable destroy intent; a fresh flip is a release still in flight and is left to its caller) is re-driven the same way (its record may already be gone: a never-written stub is deleted in the same transaction as the flip); a lease that is not `removing` and has **no record at all** is impossible through legitimate paths, so it is reported (one warning per pass) and never auto-reaped. Per-kind counts flow out as `lease_record_drift` metric records. Releases are bounded per pass and a failed release is confined to its row (left `removing` for the next pass).

The release chain itself holds no DB connection across its SSH/S3 work (intent flip + record retirement in one short transaction, then teardown, then the row delete on a fresh connection), and a `limactl delete` that finds its instance or disk already absent counts as done, so a release interrupted between the teardown and the row delete converges on retry instead of wedging in `removing`.

### Pool gauges (the fleet-version dashboards' source)

The **pool-gauge sweep** (`pool_gauge_sweep`, every 5 minutes; `POST /admin/sweep/pool-gauges` on demand, admin-key authenticated) reads the pool and emits it as `metric` log records for the OpenObserve dashboards (`apps/observability`): `pool_hosts_count` per (status, template branch, region) -- zero-filled over the known-status x observed-branch x known-region cross-product so a drained series reports 0 instead of going stale -- plus per-region `pool_slots_total` / `pool_slots_used` over ready boxes (occupancy = pool rows with a `bare_metal_server_id`; the bake's on-box check remains the real capacity guard) and a `pool_gauge_sweep_ok` heartbeat. Pure observation (two SQL reads, no external APIs), deliberately separate from the control-loop sweeps. Each `/hosts/lease` / `/hosts/claim` attempt that reaches host selection also emits one `host_lease_request` metric record tagged with its outcome (`leased` / `pool_exhausted` / `no_host_keys` / `injection_failed`) and the requested region and branch (client-supplied values are clamped to a conservative shape so they cannot mint arbitrary metric series).

### Account (signed-in user only)

- `GET /account` -- The caller's plan, entitlement values, live usage, and the available plan names. Lazily creates the entitlements row on first touch.
- `POST /account/plan` -- Switch plans. Body: `{"plan": "..."}`. Resets the account's entitlements wholesale to the plan's defaults; re-selecting the current plan is a no-op (idempotent retries never wipe operator-granted bumps). Switching to "ally" requires a paid-listed email (403 with the reason otherwise).

### Account admin API (`/admin/accounts/*`)

Email-addressed operator management of per-account entitlements, authenticated by the same fixed `MINDS_ADMIN_KEY` as the paid-list CRUD (and exposed as `minds-admin account ...`):

- `GET /admin/accounts/{email}` -- One account's plan, entitlements, live usage, and suspension state (lazily creates the row).
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/plan` -- Body `{"plan": "..."}`; always resets to the plan's defaults (the operator's way to wipe manual bumps; skips the ally eligibility check).
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/quota` -- Body `{"entitlement": "...", "value": N}`; bump a single entitlement.
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/revoke-sessions` -- Revoke every SuperTokens session of the account (standalone; sign-in stays possible). State-modifying routes verify Bearer sessions against the core per request, so a revoked session is refused within one round-trip while read access drains out over the access token's remaining ~1h lifetime.
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/suspend` -- Body `{"reason": "...", "block_storage": bool}`. Reversible, data-preserving suspension: sets the flag (every session-creation/refresh path then answers the structured `account_suspended` refusal), revokes all sessions, force-stops leased workspaces, blocks LiteLLM keys, flips R2 tokens read-only (or disables them outright under `block_storage` -- reads included), and suspends shares by state (relay tokens kept). Idempotent and re-runnable with a per-step report; re-running with `block_storage` escalates, re-running without it never de-escalates. The reason is operator-internal; users see a generic message with the support contact.
- `POST /admin/accounts/{email}/unsuspend` -- Clear the flag and restore what suspend changed (unblock keys, restore R2 access per the quota state, reactivate shares -- tunnels resume on their own once the workspace runs, since the workspace still holds its relay token). Workspaces stay stopped until the user starts them; the user signs in fresh.
- `POST /admin/workspaces/{host_db_id}/stop` -- Operator force-stop of one workspace (the owner stop transition without the ownership check; used by migrations and box drains -- the suspend fan-out runs the same transition directly, stamped `suspension`). Body `{"kind": "maintenance" | "idle" | "suspension"}` names the stop's kind (absent means `idle`); a row already stopping/stopped takes the kind without a new transition. See "Workspace stop kinds" below.
- `POST /admin/workspaces/{host_db_id}/stop-kind` -- Body `{"kind": ...}`; change the kind of a stopping/stopped workspace's stop (`idle` hands a held workspace back to its owner, unless the cutover has parked it, in which case the parked-row guard above still refuses the owner's start; `maintenance` holds one the owner stopped). 409 for any workspace that is not stopping or stopped (a running one has no stop to describe). Exposed as `minds-admin workspaces set-stop-kind`.
- `POST /admin/workspaces/{host_db_id}/start` -- Operator start of one `stopped` workspace (the owner start transition without the ownership and quota checks; the gen-2 cutover runbook's pre-window step). Exposed as `minds-admin workspaces start`.
- `POST /admin/workspaces/{host_db_id}/release` -- Operator release of one workspace regardless of owner: the owner's exact release chain (stop artifacts deleted, slice VM destroyed, workspace record retired, row dropped), for any lifecycle status including `stopped`. Idempotent (`already_released` for a row that is gone). Exposed as `minds-admin workspaces release`.

There is deliberately **no account-deletion endpoint** here: fully removing a user (its SuperTokens identity plus every connector-DB row keyed to it) is a destructive operator action done out-of-band, not something the connected clients need. Use the local operator tool `scripts/delete_accounts.py` (repo root) for that -- see "Fully deleting accounts" below.

### Fully deleting accounts (`scripts/delete_accounts.py`)

`scripts/delete_accounts.py` is a **local** operator tool (private -- not in the public-mirror allowlist, and it lives at the repo root, not in this app) that fully deletes accounts by talking directly to a tier's live backends, so it needs **no connector deploy**. For each account in a CSV it removes the connector-DB rows keyed to the user (`account_entitlements`, `workspace_records`, `account_key_bundles`, `r2_cleanup_grants`, `account_attribution`, and `shares` / `relay_tokens` keyed by the account's 32-hex share label), best-effort-deletes the LiteLLM internal user, and deletes the SuperTokens identity itself last (so a partial run is safe to re-run).

It is **dry-run by default** (prints the plan, changes nothing until `--execute`), refuses any account still holding a leased pool host (release those via `mngr pool destroy` first), tolerates target tables absent from a tier's DB, and leaves each account's `host-<hex>` R2 backup buckets to the backup-retention reaper (deleting the workspace records orphans them). Credentials resolve per value from an explicit flag, else an environment variable, else the tier's HCP Vault entries.

```bash
export VAULT_TOKEN=...   # or a prior `vault login`
# Dry run (default): show exactly what would be deleted for every account in the CSV.
uv run python scripts/delete_accounts.py --tier production --accounts-file accounts.csv
# Actually delete:
uv run python scripts/delete_accounts.py --tier production --accounts-file accounts.csv --execute
```

The accounts file is a CSV with a header row containing a `user_id` column (an `email` column, when present, is used only for reporting).

### Download redirect and marketing attribution (unauthenticated)

- `GET /download?platform=...` -- Public redirect the imbue.com marketing site's download buttons point at: records a campaign-tagged `download_events` row and 302s to the platform's installer (`mac-arm64`, alias `mac` -> the arm64 `.dmg` the **stable release channel** serves, read from `stable-mac.yml` and cached briefly, falling back to a build pinned in `_DEFAULT_TARGET_BY_PLATFORM` -- bumped to the promoted build at every stable promotion, and drift-tested against `apps/minds/release-channels.toml` -- when the manifest cannot be read; `source` -> the public GitHub repo; unknown or missing platforms 404). The event is tagged by the usual merge rule: the `imbue_attribution` cookie supplies the visitor id and first touch, and campaign params on the `/download` URL itself overwrite the last touch (or synthesize the sole touch when the cookie is absent); the redirect always happens even when the event write fails.

New accounts are additionally stamped with marketing attribution at creation time (never on sign-in), on both browser signup paths (email-password and Google OAuth): one write-once `account_attribution` row per account, built from the `imbue_attribution` cookie (set server-side by imbue.com's edge function on `.imbue.com`) merged with the signup page's own campaign params. Capture fails open, so it can never break a signup. The cookie's schema, set/update rules, and the download/signup link formats are pinned in [docs/attribution-cookie-contract.md](docs/attribution-cookie-contract.md); the connector-side logic lives in `attribution.py`, the tables come from `migrations/026_account_attribution.sql`, and reporting is plain SQL against Neon (no admin surface).

### Auth

These endpoints front the SuperTokens core so that clients (e.g. the `minds` desktop client) never need the SuperTokens API key. They require `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` (and usually `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY`) to be configured on the server; otherwise they return 503. All of them are unauthenticated *except* `/auth/session/revoke`, `/auth/session/revoke-current`, `/auth/email/send-verification`, and `/auth/email/is-verified`, which must be called with the caller's own access token (see below); those deliberately accept a session whose email is not yet verified.

#### Deprecated JSON auth endpoints

`POST /auth/signup` and `POST /auth/signin` are **deprecated** in favor of the browser-based accounts surface (consumed by `mngr imbue_cloud auth login`). Account **creation** through the JSON API is disabled on production and staging: `POST /auth/signup` there answers status `SIGNUP_DISABLED` with a message pointing at the browser flow, so every new account goes through the Turnstile-gated web signup (or Google). Dev/CI tiers keep the headless JSON signup because it makes testing easy, and the admin-key `POST /admin/test-signup` endpoint covers deployment tests everywhere. Sign-in stays available on every tier. The old JSON OAuth pair (`/auth/oauth/authorize` + `/auth/oauth/callback`) is **removed** -- Google sign-in exists only as the accounts surface's browser flow. The `needs_email_verification` response field is pinned `false` for wire compat -- verification is non-blocking, and old clients treat `true` as "blocked pending verification".

- `POST /auth/signup` (deprecated; disabled on production/staging, see above) -- Body: `{email, password}`. Returns status, user info, and session tokens. No verification email is sent at signup (the first verification-gated action triggers a contextual send). Refused with status `ACCOUNT_EXISTS_WITH_OTHER_METHOD` when the email is already registered under a different login method (e.g. Google), and with status `SIGNUP_DISABLED` on the restricted tiers.
- `POST /auth/signin` (deprecated, see above) -- Body: `{email, password}`. Returns status, user info, and session tokens; an unverified email does not block sign-in.
- `POST /auth/session/refresh` -- Body: `{refresh_token}`. Returns a new access/refresh token pair.
- `POST /auth/session/revoke` -- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Revokes every SuperTokens session for the caller's user. The user_id is derived from the access token, so an anonymous caller cannot revoke another user's sessions. The hosted account page's "sign out of all devices" action.
- `POST /auth/session/revoke-current` -- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Revokes only the presented session. Called on desktop sign-out so signing out of one install does not kill the user's browser session or other devices.
- `POST /admin/test-signup` -- Admin-key authenticated (like `/admin/accounts/*`). Body: `{email, password, verified}`. Creates a test account, optionally pre-verified (the only path that marks an email verified without a clicked link); used by the deployment tests.
- `POST /auth/email/send-verification` -- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Body: `{email}`; the email must belong to the authenticated caller (403 otherwise). Sends the verification email; returns `{status, sent}` where `sent` is false when the per-user cooldown suppressed the send.
- `POST /auth/email/is-verified` -- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Body: `{email}`; the email must belong to the authenticated caller (403 otherwise). Returns `{verified: bool}`.
- `GET /auth/verify-email?token=...` -- Serves the hosted accounts bundle's verify-email result page (the page consumes the token via `POST /accounts/api/verify-email`). Used by the link inside verification emails.
- `POST /auth/password/forgot` -- Body: `{email}`. Always returns OK (to avoid account enumeration).
- `POST /auth/password/reset` -- Body: `{token, new_password}`. Consumes a reset token and sets a new password.
- `GET /auth/reset-password?token=...` -- Serves the hosted accounts bundle's password-reset form (the form posts to `POST /auth/password/reset`). Used by the link inside password-reset emails.
- `GET /auth/users/{user_id}` -- Returns basic info about a user (email, login provider).
