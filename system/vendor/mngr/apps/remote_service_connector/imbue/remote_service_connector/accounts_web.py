"""The hosted accounts surface: browser sign-in/sign-up pages and the device handoff.

This is the primary way users get an Imbue account and sign clients into it:

- The Minds-branded pages (login, signup, account management) are a small
  built frontend bundle served at ``/login`` / ``/signup`` / ``/manage``,
  with its JSON API under ``/accounts/api/*``.
- Browser sessions are SuperTokens' own cookie-based sessions (the SDK
  middleware is mounted by ``init_supertokens`` with the accounts api base
  path), so rotation, revocation, and refresh come from the SDK rather than a
  hand-rolled cookie.
- The desktop app / CLI sign in via the loopback handoff: the app opens
  ``/login?next=/accounts/authorize?...`` in the system browser, the user
  authenticates (or confirms "Continue as ..."), and ``/accounts/authorize``
  mints a short-lived one-time code bound to a PKCE challenge and redirects
  to the app's ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback``. The app exchanges the
  code at ``POST /auth/device/token`` for its own SuperTokens session.
- The share flow uses the same surface: the accounts broker's
  ``/share/authorize`` resolves the same browser session and bounces
  visitors to the same ``/login`` page (see ``share_broker.py``).

The SuperTokens SDK calls are wrapped in module-level ``_sdk_*`` seams so the
unit tests can drive the handlers against the in-memory fake backend without
a real core (matching the seam pattern used across this package).
