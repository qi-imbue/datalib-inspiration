"""Workspace lifecycle endpoints: list/get across all states, stop, start, abandon.

``GET /hosts`` (the deprecated leased-only listing) stays for released
clients; these endpoints are the full-lifecycle replacement. A workspace is
a ``pool_hosts`` row leased to the caller, in one of:

* ``running``  -- the VM is up (DB status ``leased``)
* ``stopping`` -- VM halted, upload in flight
* ``stopped``  -- artifact in object storage; the halted local VM (and the
  bare-metal slot) is kept for the retention window so a start within it
  restarts in place, then reaped
* ``starting`` -- a supervisor is restoring/booting it
* ``crashed``  -- operator-abandoned (recover from the workspace backup)

Beside the status, ``stop_kind`` records why the current stop happened and so
who may start the workspace again (specs/workspace-stop-kinds.md): ``owner``
(the user's own stop, from any device), ``maintenance`` (an operator hold such
as the gen-1 -> gen-2 migration; only an operator start brings it back),
``idle`` (an operator stop to free capacity; the user may start it) or
``suspension`` (the suspend fan-out; rewritten to ``idle`` at unsuspend).
Every stop stamps it and every start clears it; NULL (a row stopped before the
column existed) reads as ``owner``.

Stop/start are asynchronous: they CAS the row into the transition status
(minting the fencing ``transition_id`` the spawned supervisor owns), spawn a
supervisor, and return 202; clients poll ``GET /workspaces/{id}``. Transitions
only begin from the stable states (``leased`` for stop, ``stopped`` for
start); a request against a row mid-transition is answered 409 with the
current status so the caller re-reads state and retries when it settles.
