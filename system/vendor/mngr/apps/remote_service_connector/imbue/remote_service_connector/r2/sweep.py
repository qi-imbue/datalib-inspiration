"""R2 storage-quota sweep (hourly cron body).

Hourly cron: reads every bucket's peak stored bytes from the GraphQL
analytics dataset (one query per sweep regardless of bucket count, one row
per bucket), sums per owner, and flips bucket-key token policies in place --
readwrite keys of an over-quota owner become read-only (same S3
credentials, so reads keep working while writes fail), and are restored
automatically once the owner is back under quota. The GraphQL number is a
lookback-window *peak*, so it is only a screening filter: before any
downgrade the owner is re-measured with the real-time REST usage endpoint
(the same source the grant/recheck endpoints read), which makes the sweep
and an out-of-band restore unable to disagree. The sweep also settles
expired cleanup grants, skips owners with an active grant (so a mid-prune
measurement never re-locks them), and permanently enforces the
single-key-per-bucket invariant: any bucket with more than one recorded key
has the extras revoked (newest wins), which doubles as the one-time cleanup
of multi-key buckets minted before this model.
