"""Frozen snapshot of the minds 0.4.0 client's tolerant connector-response models.

This file pins what the 0.4.0 desktop client can parse: the first release
whose wire models are tolerant ``WireModel``s (``extra="ignore"``, enums
coerced to ``UNKNOWN``), so additive server changes can no longer break it.
What CAN still break it -- and what this snapshot therefore pins -- is the
required-field surface: removing, renaming, or re-typing a required response
field fails these models exactly as it would fail the shipped client. The
golden compat test (``wire_compat_test.py``) validates the connector's live
responses against every snapshot in this package, so such a change fails CI
before it can deploy.

Snapshot rules (each file here follows them):

- Self-contained: no imports from ``imbue.*`` -- the point is that later
  refactors of the live code can never silently loosen what a snapshot
  asserts. Only pydantic + stdlib.
- Never edited to match a server change. A snapshot changes only when it is
  PRUNED (its release left the support window -- see ``SUPPORT_ENDS``) or a
  new release's snapshot is added beside it.
- ``MODEL_BY_ENDPOINT`` maps each endpoint whose response this client parses
  STRICTLY (``validate_wire`` / ``parse_wire_entries`` on a wire model) to
  the model it used. Endpoints the client parsed tolerantly (hand-rolled
  ``.get()`` readers, raw dicts, status-only enum coercions) cannot be
  broken by response-shape changes and are deliberately absent -- notably
  the workspace stop/start transitions, whose 0.4.0 reader coerces even a
  missing ``status`` to UNKNOWN.

RELEASE_DATE = date(2026, 8, 18)

# The date this snapshot stops being enforced: prune the file then (or extend
# this date deliberately). Set to the release date + the ~1 month support
# window; later releases that share this strictly-parsed surface extend this
# date instead of adding a new snapshot (see docs:
# apps/minds/docs/deploy/ops/app-release.md).
# Also covers minds 0.4.1 (released 2026-08-18): its strictly-parsed connector
# surface is identical to 0.4.0's (no wire_types or connector response changes
# between the two tags), and its support window ends the same date.
# Also covers minds 0.4.2 (released 2026-08-24): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- the only wire_types changes between the two tags are
# docstrings, field descriptions, and the additive operator-only
# AdminAccountInfo, which no strictly-parsed endpoint maps to.
# Also covers minds 0.4.3 (released 2026-08-29): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- the only wire_types changes between the two tags are field
# descriptions and the additive optional SyncWorkspaceRecord.backup_bucket
# field (default None), which adds no required field; no new strict-parse call
# sites were added client-side.
# Also covers minds 0.4.4 (released 2026-08-31): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- the only wire_types change between the two tags is the
# additive optional ShareInfo.chrome_origin field (default None), which adds no
# required field; no new strict-parse call sites were added client-side.
# Also covers minds 0.5.0 (released 2026-09-02): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- wire_types.py is byte-unchanged between minds-v0.4.4 and
# this tag, and no new strict-parse call sites were added client-side. The
# release is a minor bump for the workspace-side sign-in and chat rewrite, none
# of which crosses the connector wire.
# Also covers minds 0.5.1 (released 2026-09-08): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- wire_types.py is byte-unchanged between minds-v0.5.0 and
# this tag, and no new strict-parse call sites were added client-side. The
# release moves credential and permission-policy ownership onto each machine,
# none of which crosses the connector wire.
# Also covers minds 0.5.2 (released 2026-09-09): the strictly-parsed surface is
# still identical -- wire_types.py is byte-unchanged between minds-v0.5.1 and
# this tag, and no new strict-parse call sites were added client-side.
# Also covers minds 0.6.0 (released 2026-09-13, the gen-2 slice-fleet release):
# the strictly-parsed surface is still identical -- every wire_types.py change
# between minds-v0.5.2 and this tag is an additive optional field with a default
# (box_generation, the machine-sizing units/disk fields and their pending
# targets, the machine-unit entitlement and usage fields), which adds no
# required field, and the one new client route (POST /machines/{id}/resize) is
# parsed tolerantly.
# Also covers minds 0.6.1 (released 2026-09-14): the only wire_types.py change
# since minds-v0.6.0 is the optional ``stop_kind`` field on the workspace entry
# (defaulting to None) and the ``WorkspaceStopKind`` WireEnum it carries, which
# adds no required field. Its support window ends 2026-10-14.
