"""Workspace sync: records + account key bundles.

Per-account workspace records: one row per workspace, keyed by the workspace
id (the workspace's system-services agent id); the machine it runs on
(``host_id``) is a mutable attribute. Rows hold plaintext metadata (name,
color, provider, location, lifecycle state) plus an opaque,
client-side-encrypted secrets blob the server can never read. Writes are
compare-and-swap on a per-row revision counter, addressed by workspace id
(the ``/sync/records/by-workspace/{workspace_id}`` routes); the host-keyed
routes survive as compat shims -- the DELETE resolves the row through its
host_id column, while the PUT checks the path against the body's host_id and
then addresses the row by the body's agent_id. The account key bundle holds the argon2id inputs and the
password-wrapped data-encryption key (also opaque). All endpoints require
user (SuperTokens) auth but are NOT paid-gated -- sync is a free feature.

Records and pool leases are two views of one cloud workspace, and the
connector keeps them consistent: a lease grant inserts a metadata-only record
stub in the same transaction (``insert_lease_record_stub``), a release
tombstones the record -- or deletes it while it is still that never-written
stub -- in the same transaction as its ``removing`` flip
(``retire_active_record_for_lease``), and a record whose workspace still
holds a lease can be tombstoned but never hard-deleted -- neither by the
DELETE routes nor by the retention reaper. The lease-vs-record sweep in
``lease_records.py`` acts on the remaining drift.
