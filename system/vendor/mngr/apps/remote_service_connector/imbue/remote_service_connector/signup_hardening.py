"""IP-based hardening for the hosted signup surface (issue mngr-internal#467).

Layers, applied to both account-creation paths in ``accounts_web`` (the
password form and the Google OAuth callback's new-account branch):

- **Velocity limits**: per-IP (last hour) and per-subnet (/24 v4, /48 v6,
  last day) caps on signup attempts, counted from the Neon-backed
  ``signup_attempts`` table (the connector's containers share no memory).
  The caps are far above any human's rate and far below a flood's -- the
  2026-08 incident ran ~1,700 signups/hour from one IP.
- **IP reputation**: the IPinfo Max lookup API (``IPINFO_TOKEN``; residential
  proxies fold into the same ``proxy`` flag as open proxies), cached per IP
  in Neon so repeat lookups are free, plus a zero-dependency Tor-exit-list
  check that works with no token configured.
- **Graduated verdict**: tor/hosting IPs are blocked outright; vpn/proxy/
  relay IPs are stepped up to OAuth-only (Google survives -- reaching a real
  OAuth token is far more expensive for a bot than spinning email/password
  accounts); clean IPs are untouched.

Every gated attempt is recorded (verdict + outcome + IP + subnet), allowed
ones included, so the next flood is visible in real time instead of being
reconstructed from Modal logs after the fact.

Everything here fails OPEN, without exception: a Neon or provider outage
degrades signup to "Turnstile only" with a warning log. Turnstile (in
``accounts_web``) remains the sole fail-closed gate. Enforcement applies on
the tiers whose signup is restricted to the hosted surface (production /
staging, the ``is_json_signup_disabled`` line); dev/CI tiers record verdicts
but never refuse, matching their open headless-signup posture.

The trusted client IP is the ASGI socket peer -- see
``modal_app_kit.request_logging.client_ip_from_asgi_scope`` for the verified
Modal ingress semantics (X-Forwarded-For is stripped; other forwarding
headers are unsanitized and must never be consulted).
