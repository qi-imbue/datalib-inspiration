# Modal Secret carries it into the container. See
# ``apps/minds_admin/imbue/minds_admin/envs/generation.py`` for the full lifecycle.

# ``deploy.toml`` has ``[lifecycle].tracks_generation = false`` (dev tier
# today) -- ``deploy_env`` only mints + pushes a generation id when the
# flag is true, so the connector sees no value and ``/generation``
# answers ``{"generation_id": ""}``. The activate-time auto-wipe in
# ``minds-admin env activate`` skips the wipe on empty, which is the right
