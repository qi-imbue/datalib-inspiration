"""LiteLLM proxy deployed as a Modal serverless function.

This file is deployed by file path (``modal deploy app.py``), so Modal ships
just this file plus the packages added via ``add_local_python_source`` below
(today: ``imbue.modal_app_kit``, our shared Modal deploy conventions).
Anything else from the monorepo must NOT be imported here -- it would work
locally and crash the container at import time. See
libs/modal_app_kit/README.md for the deployment model.

LiteLLM's native ``POST /v1/messages`` route accepts the Anthropic API
request shape, so the Anthropic SDK / Claude Code can talk to the proxy
by setting ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` to the proxy's root URL (no path
suffix). The SDK appends ``/v1/messages`` itself. All requests go
through LiteLLM's virtual key system for cost tracking.

Usage:
    # Push secrets to Modal + deploy in one shot:
    eval "$(uv run minds-admin env activate production)"
    uv run minds-admin env deploy --yes-i-mean-production

    # Use with claude -p (replace with your virtual key and Modal URL)
    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://<workspace>--llm-production-proxy.modal.run/ \\
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-your-virtual-key \\
    claude -p "hello"

# ``anthropic/claude-<rest>``. The pattern is deliberately ``claude-*`` rather
# than a bare ``*``: this proxy holds only an Anthropic credential, so a non-Claude
# name should fail here as an unknown model rather than be forwarded to Anthropic
# and come back as a confusing upstream error. (An Anthropic model that does not
# start with ``claude-`` would need this pattern widened.) Pricing comes from litellm's own model-cost map, fetched
# remotely at startup (``LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP`` is deliberately unset), so
# a new Anthropic model is routable and priced the day litellm's map carries it,
# with no entry to add here.
#
# The map also carries dimensions an inline per-token price cannot express, and
# which the previous enumerated config therefore got wrong: the fast-mode premium
# (``provider_specific_entry.fast``, 2x on Opus 5 / 4.8), the regional uplift, and
# the 1-hour cache-write rate (``cache_creation_input_token_cost_above_1hr``, 2x
