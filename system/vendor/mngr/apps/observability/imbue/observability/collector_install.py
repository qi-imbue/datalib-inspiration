"""Rendering one machine's OpenTelemetry Collector config + self-contained install script.

One pinned ``otelcol-contrib`` runs per bare-metal slice box, share-relay VPS,
and observability instance host: hostmetrics + the systemd journal, pushed
over OTLP HTTP to the tier's ingest hostname with a per-sender-class
credential and a file-backed sending queue (instance downtime buffers on the
sender instead of dropping).

The install script is deliberately self-contained (the rendered config rides
inside it as a heredoc) so every install path is the same single artifact: the
box prep flow (``minds-admin server prep`` / ``setup``) renders and appends it
in-process, the relay flow and the instance deploy run it over SSH.

The collector config is YAML because the OpenTelemetry Collector requires
YAML -- this is a third-party tool's mandated format (like cloud-init's), not
one of our config files.
