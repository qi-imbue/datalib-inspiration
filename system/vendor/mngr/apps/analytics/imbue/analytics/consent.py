"""Consent and enumeration for in-workspace collection.

Consent IS explorer-plan membership: every poll reads the current explorer
set from the connector's product database (read-only role) and diffs it into
the ops ``consent_ledger``. Leaving the plan stops collection at the next poll
and deletes nothing. Enumeration then lists the online, non-transitioning
pool workspaces leased to consenting accounts.

The pool_hosts lease column carries the 16-hex user-id prefix, so the join to
``account_entitlements`` goes through ``user_id_prefix``; the full SuperTokens
user id is the analytics key everywhere downstream.
