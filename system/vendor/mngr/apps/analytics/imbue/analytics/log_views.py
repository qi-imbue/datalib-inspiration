"""Views over the OpenObserve log parquet, parsed into typed columns.

OpenObserve's data plane is zstd parquet in the tier's R2 bucket; our service
log lines (the connector's ``http_request`` access records and
``share_visit_authorized`` records) arrive inside it as JSON strings in the
record body. The emitting formatter (``modal_app_kit``'s
``StructuredRecordJsonLogFormatter``) flattens each record into a JSON
envelope that adds ``level`` / ``timestamp`` / ``logger`` alongside the
record's own top-level fields, so ``type`` and the fields read here sit at
the top level of the body. These views parse that JSON defensively: lines
written before the JSON envelope carry a logging formatter's timestamp
prefix, so the JSON is extracted from the first ``{`` onward (a no-op for
pure-JSON bodies); a malformed or foreign body simply yields NULLs and is
filtered out by the ``type`` predicate, never an error.

The parquet layout and the body/timestamp column names are OpenObserve
internals -- pinned here as parameters (with production defaults in
``settings``) so a version bump only means re-verifying and adjusting the
configuration, not the SQL.
