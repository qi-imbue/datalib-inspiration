"""DuckDB session assembly: DuckLake attach, source attaches, and maintenance.

One aggregation run works inside a single DuckDB session with fixed catalog
aliases, so every SQL statement is source-agnostic:

- ``metrics`` -- the metrics DuckLake (writable; Neon catalog + R2 data)
- ``rsc`` -- the connector's product database (Postgres, read-only)
- ``ops`` -- the analytics ops database (Postgres, read-only here; writes go
  through psycopg2 in ``ops_db``)
- ``logs`` -- a schema of views over the OpenObserve parquet (see
  ``log_views``)

Tests build the same aliases from local fixtures (a plain DuckDB database
attached as ``metrics``/``rsc``/``ops``), so the aggregation SQL under test is
byte-identical to production.
