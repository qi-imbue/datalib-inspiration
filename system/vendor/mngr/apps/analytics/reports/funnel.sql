-- Acquisition funnel by day: downloads -> signups -> first workspaces.
--
-- Downloads come from the marketing site's /download redirect (visitor-id
-- keyed, no account yet; recorded only since 2026-08-21 -- see the README's
-- "Data start dates"); signups from the SuperTokens backfill coalesced with
-- account_attribution (the aggregation applies the rule); first_workspaces
-- counts accounts whose first-ever workspace record landed that day. The
-- table carries every day in its range, zero-filled, so charts show gaps as
-- zeros. Attribution joins (campaign -> signup) are plain SQL against the
-- connector's account_attribution / download_events tables via the same
-- aggregation source if needed -- this report stays at the daily-count level.
