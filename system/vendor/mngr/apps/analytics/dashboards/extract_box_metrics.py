"""Extract a dev env's bare-metal box telemetry into a local DuckDB file for the Evidence dashboards.

The tier's OpenObserve instance lands every OTLP metric as parquet in the
shared observability R2 bucket (one directory per metric stream). This script
reads the hostmetrics streams for the boxes registered to ONE dev env (the
``bare_metal_servers`` table in that env's own connector database identifies
them; the shared dev bucket also carries other envs' boxes, relays, and Modal
metrics), pre-aggregates them into small chart-ready tables, and writes them
to ``data/box_metrics.duckdb`` for ``evidence sources`` to consume.

Credentials come from the env's local deploy state
(``~/.minds-<env>/secrets.toml``, written by ``minds-admin env deploy``): the
read-only key on the observability bucket plus the analytics_reader DSN on the
env's connector database. Run from the repo root:

    uv run python apps/analytics/dashboards/extract_box_metrics.py --env dev-josh-1
