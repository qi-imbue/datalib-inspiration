// Warms a machine's permissions overview before its pane is opened.

// usually lands on an answer that is already here. For a remote machine the
// read is a round trip to that machine (it is answered by asking the machine
// itself what it holds), so the head start is worth more than it used to be.
//
// Deliberately NOT warmed on entering a machine, for the same reason: a
// machine is entered far more often than its permissions are read, and every
// read costs that machine a command.
