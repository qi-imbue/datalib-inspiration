// Model for the options panel's Permissions tab: the machine's whole toggle
// tree plus the single-flip writes that replace it.
//
// A flip POSTs ONLY the flipped permission and its new state; the server
// recomputes the affected rule's complete permission set and answers with the
// refreshed FULL view, which is adopted verbatim. The pane therefore renders
// what was actually stored rather than an optimistic guess, at the cost of one
// round trip per flip.
//
// For a remote workspace the server also carries the change to that workspace's
// own machine before answering, and the read fetches that machine's state, so
// both are as slow as the network to it. Nothing here is optimistic: `isWriting`
// locks the whole pane for the duration, so what is on screen is always
// something the machine has confirmed.
//
// Loading is separate from WorkspaceOptionsModel's: an unreachable latchkey
// gateway must not take the Share or Settings tabs down with it.
//
// Add connection has two writes, because a service has two ways of being
// connected: the settings page's browser sign-in, and -- for the services
// latchkey cannot sign in to -- this pane's own credential form. Both end the
// same way, on the connection they produced.
