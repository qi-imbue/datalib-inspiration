// Approve busy states (progress -> granted/denied / needs-manual-credentials /
// failed), fire-and-forget Deny, the file-sharing path validation (home
// expansion + within-roots), and the predefined dialog's wildcard-permission
// exclusivity. Grants/denies submit the SAME form fields to the legacy
// /requests/<id>/grant|deny routes.
//
// ONE request per open, and answering it closes: the page is opened on the
// request the reader picked -- a "Waiting on you" row, an in-chat card -- so
// the review they asked for is over when that request has a verdict, and
// swapping the next pending one in under the click that finished it would
// answer a question nobody had asked yet. The list they picked from is where
// closing takes them (see returnToPanelAfterRequest).
