// Machine recovery (/agents/<id>/recovery): the recovery card on a surface of
// its own, for a window with nothing of the machine on screen -- a cold entry,
// or a click into a machine from a list. Nothing is being preserved here, so
// navigating costs nothing, and the titlebar stays above it throughout (home,
// switcher and inbox remain reachable).
//
// When the machine IS on screen the same card renders as a modal instead
// (RecoveryModal). The card is shared wholesale; this page supplies no corner
// control where the modal supplies its X, and nothing else differs. There is
// nothing for a corner control to do here: the page is reached only because the
// machine would not load, so a dismissal would leave the reader on a machine
// that is not there.
//
// Once the machine IS answering, though, the page is the only thing between the
// reader and it, and it supplies the card's "Open machine" button. That is the
// same moment the ?return_to below fires, and deliberately so: the redirect is
// the path, and the button is what is left when there is no ?return_to to
// follow (a hand-typed or stale URL) or when the redirect is held back -- and
// it costs nothing when the redirect does fire, since the two land in the same
// place and the reader never sees the card again either way.
//
// NEVER auto-navigated to, and never linked to by the shell's band, which
// raises the modal instead. Unattended recovery is dispatched by the server's
// health tracker on the STUCK edge, so this page reports a recovery already
// under way rather than racing to start one. The way in, and the only thing
// that dispatches from here, is a machines-list click-through:
// ?intent=start ("open this stopped machine" -- a plain, idempotent start) and
// ?intent=restart ("restart this machine" -- the full stop+start bounce).
