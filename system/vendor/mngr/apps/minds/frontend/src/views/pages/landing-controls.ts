/**
 * What a row's health badge says, or null for a machine with nothing to report.
 *
 * The badge states what was observed, not what the app is attempting. Three of
 * the four readings would otherwise overstate:
 *
 * A connection that failed on this device outranks every reading below it,
 * because it explains them rather than restating them: the machine reads
 * unhealthy *because* this device could not build a connection to it, and may
 * well be running fine and serving other devices. This is the same rank the
 * recovery card and the shell's notice band give it, and it has to be, or the
 * list keeps blaming a machine that the card behind it exonerates -- which is
 * the misdiagnosis the whole decomposition exists to end, surviving in the one
 * surface that never read the verdict.
 *
 * The "recovering" wire state covers two different things: the user's own full
 * bounce, and the start the app fires at a machine that stopped answering. Only
 * the first is a restart. The second is idempotent and no-ops against a host
 * that is already up, so calling it one tells the user their work was
 * interrupted when nothing happened to the machine -- it is reported as the
 * connection being re-established instead. `recoveryKind` is the same evidence
 * the recovery card picks its heading from, read here so the two surfaces
 * cannot describe one episode differently; its null (no recovery the tracker
 * can describe) takes the weaker reading, as the card does. (The caller
 * suppresses the badge for a machine whose liveness reads STOPPED or
 * transitional, which is where the card says "Bringing ... back online"
 * instead.)
 *
 * The last reading, "recovery_failed", is where the badge would overstate one
 * step later: when the dispatched start reported it booted no host, the machine
 * was up throughout -- it was never taken down and brought back, so a "Restart
 * failed" badge describes something the user did not experience. It reads as a
 * machine that never answered instead.
