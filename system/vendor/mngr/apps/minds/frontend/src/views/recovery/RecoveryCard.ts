// it -- and as the recovery page when there is not (a cold entry, or a click
// into a machine from somewhere else). The two shells differ in exactly one
// thing: the modal supplies an X, and the page supplies nothing. The page is
// only ever reached because the machine would not load, so a corner button
// back to it would name the one destination that is known not to work; the
// titlebar above the page is the way out.
//
// The card describes the machine's condition, not the history of what has
// already been tried. The app starts a wedged machine on its own, so an
// account of a failed recovery would usually be describing an event the user
// never caused and never saw.

 * probe behind it anymore: the probe and the route that reached it are both
 * gone, and what the background health tracker observes goes to the log rather
 * than to a list of questions nobody could act on.
 *
 * The two sources are deduped on the string itself, because usually they carry
 * one: every server-side recovery failure hands the same message to the tracker
 * and to the operation record, and printing it twice reads as two faults. They
 * are still both consulted, since either can be the only one there -- a
 * dispatch this card never got to start reports client-side only, and an
 * unattended start that failed before this card opened is the tracker's
