// The persistent app shell: titlebar + switcher popover + the routed page
// body. Body modes, matching ChromeShell.jinja:
//
// - Local page: content scrolls inside #local-page-scroll, the inset white
//   card below the fixed titlebar (accent bleeds around it).
// - Agent content surface (/workspace/<id>): the page IS the fixed iframe
//   surface; no scroll container. The options route (/workspace/<id>/options)
//   keeps the frame mounted and renders the routed content as its own overlay
//   layer over it -- a docked panel hanging from the titlebar's icon-tabs (the
//   SPA heir of the legacy docked WorkspaceOptionsModal), which self-chromes,
//   so the Shell just floats it over the still-mounted surface.
// - App-level modals (/settings, /accounts, /help, /inbox): the routed content
//   floats in a centered AppOverlay card over the surface it was opened from --
//   the live workspace (Get help and the request popup forward ?workspace=) or
//   Home -- which stays mounted behind the dim backdrop, restoring the legacy
//   overlay-layer modals. The options panel, when a modal was opened over it,
//   stays mounted too: it holds the same vtree slot either way.
