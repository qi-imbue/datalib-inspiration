 * explained -- so the strip is not rewritten as an explanation lands and
 * clears. Discovery death does not: it is not this machine's condition at all,

 *
 * An update's apply step ranks above the machine's own health (it explains it)
 * but below this device's own condition (it does not); the rest of a run ranks
 * below all of them.
 *
 * A machine in a connector-owned lifecycle state (stopping, stopped, starting)
 * is expectedly unreachable, so its health reading is masked to healthy before
 * any of the above is consulted. When that stop is an operator's maintenance
 * hold, the band says so instead -- ranked right after discovery death, above
 * this device's own condition: the machine is down because someone asked for
