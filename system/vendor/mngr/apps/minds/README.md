# minds

Run persistent, autonomous AI agents with web access and global forwarding.

## Overview

The minds app creates and manages persistent Claude agents running in Docker containers. Each agent gets:

- A local web interface accessible through the desktop client
- Optional workspace sharing over a self-hosted relay, with TLS terminated inside the workspace
- Apps (terminal, etc.) and background services supervised by supervisord
- The ability to expose app ports via both local and global URLs

## Getting started

minds ships as a desktop app (Electron, packaged via ToDesktop; see
[docs/desktop-app.md](./docs/desktop-app.md)).

To run it from source for development, follow the setup guide
**[docs/dev-setup.md](./docs/dev-setup.md)**: install the one-time
prerequisites (Docker, Node/pnpm, GNU rsync, GitHub access, Vault, Modal),
then the `minds-dev-workflow` skill takes you through first-time bootstrap and
the every-startup launch. You create your first agent from the login URL the
app prints on startup.

## How it works

1. The **desktop client** (`minds run`) runs locally and provides:
   - Authentication via one-time login codes
   - A web UI for creating agents from template repositories
   - Reverse proxying to agent web servers (HTTP + WebSocket)
   - A servers page showing local and shared URLs per agent
   - Controls for enabling/disabling sharing (a per-workspace share on a self-hosted relay)

2. **Agents** are created from template repositories (like [default-workspace-template](https://github.com/imbue-ai/default-workspace-template)) using `mngr create`. The template's `.mngr/settings.toml` drives all configuration.

3. Inside each minds container, the "primary" agent (`system-services`) runs only the bootstrap and background services -- it is a plain `command`-type agent whose window-0 command is `sleep infinity`, so no claude is ever involved. The user's chat agents are separate `mngr` agents created on demand: the workspace boots with no chat (it opens on its new-tab screen), and each chat binds to a provider account -- a folder under `~/.minds/accounts` minted by the sign-in flow -- when it is created (the credential rides `mngr create`'s own flags, so claude chats point at their account via a per-agent `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the agent's env file, and other harnesses follow a credential symlink in the agent's state directory). Destroying chat agents does not affect services; the services agent is hidden from the UI agent list (it carries `is_primary=true`) and protected against direct destroy.

4. Inside the services agent's Docker container:
   - The bootstrap (`uv run bootstrap`) runs first-boot setup and then execs `supervisord -n`, which supervises the background services declared as `[program:*]` sections in `supervisord.conf`, or in the drop-in files its `[include]` glob pulls in
   - Apps register their ports via `system/scripts/forward_port.py` into `data/.state/apps.toml`
   - An **app watcher** service monitors `apps.toml` and writes server events to `events.jsonl` for discovery
   - A **share-gateway** service watches `data/.secrets/share.env` for relay materials and runs the workspace's share stack (relay tunnel + in-workspace TLS) while sharing is enabled

## Testing live deployments

The `apps/minds/deployment_tests/` suite exercises real deployed minds services and the deploy process itself, driven by an operator-invoked orchestrator (`just minds-test-deployment`). See [`apps/minds/deployment_tests/README.md`](./deployment_tests/README.md) for the runbook and [`specs/minds-deployment-tests.md`](../../specs/minds-deployment-tests.md) for the full design.
