# minds

Run persistent, autonomous AI agents with web access and global forwarding.

## Overview

The minds app creates and manages persistent Claude agents running in Docker containers. Each agent gets:

- A local web interface accessible through the desktop client
- Optional global access via Cloudflare tunnels (with Google OAuth protection)
- Apps (terminal, etc.) and background services supervised by supervisord
- The ability to expose app ports via both local and global URLs

## Getting started

minds ships as a desktop app (Electron, packaged via ToDesktop; see
[docs/desktop-app.md](./docs/desktop-app.md)).

To run it from source for development, follow the setup guide
**[docs/dev-setup.md](./docs/dev-setup.md)**: install the one-time
prerequisites (Docker, Node/pnpm, GNU rsync, GitHub access, Vault, Modal),
then the `minds-dev-workflow` skill takes you through first-time bootstrap and
the every-startup launch. You create your first agent from the login URL the
app prints on startup.

## How it works

1. The **desktop client** (`minds run`) runs locally and provides:
   - Authentication via one-time login codes
   - A web UI for creating agents from template repositories
   - Reverse proxying to agent web servers (HTTP + WebSocket)
   - A servers page showing local and global URLs per agent
   - Toggle controls for enabling/disabling global Cloudflare forwarding

2. **Agents** are created from template repositories (like [default-workspace-template](https://github.com/imbue-ai/default-workspace-template)) using `mngr create`. The template's `.mngr/settings.toml` drives all configuration.

3. Inside each minds container, the "primary" agent (`system-services`) runs only the bootstrap and background services -- it is a plain `command`-type agent whose window-0 command is `sleep infinity`, so no claude is ever involved. The user's actual chat agent is a separate `mngr` agent created by the bootstrap on first boot (named after the host). `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is deliberately unset workspace-wide, so every claude in the workspace (mngr-launched agents and a bare `claude` in a terminal alike) shares claude's own default `~/.claude` -- auth, plugins, marketplaces, and sessions are configured once and shared. Destroying chat agents does not affect services; the services agent is hidden from the UI agent list (it carries `is_primary=true`) and protected against direct destroy.

4. Inside the services agent's Docker container:
   - The bootstrap (`uv run bootstrap`) runs first-boot setup and then execs `supervisord -n`, which supervises the background services declared as `[program:*]` sections in `supervisord.conf`
   - On first boot the bootstrap also creates the initial chat agent (gated by `data/.state/initial_chat_created`)
   - Apps register their ports via `system/scripts/forward_port.py` into `data/.state/apps.toml`
   - An **app watcher** service monitors `apps.toml` and writes server events to `events.jsonl` for discovery
   - A **cloudflared** service watches `data/.secrets` for a tunnel token and runs the Cloudflare tunnel

## Testing live deployments

The `apps/minds/deployment_tests/` suite exercises real deployed minds services and the deploy process itself, driven by an operator-invoked orchestrator (`just minds-test-deployment`). See [`apps/minds/deployment_tests/README.md`](./deployment_tests/README.md) for the runbook and [`specs/minds-deployment-tests.md`](../../specs/minds-deployment-tests.md) for the full design.
