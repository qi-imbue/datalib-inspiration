# Vault Setup

Deploy-time secrets for the minds Modal apps (`remote_service_connector`,
`litellm-proxy`) are stored in **HCP Vault** and pushed to Modal Secrets
by the deploy scripts. This doc describes the Vault layout each tier
expects, plus what every operator needs on their machine.

User-side secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, etc.) do **not** go
through Vault; they stay as shell env vars on the operator's machine.

## Prerequisites

- The HCP Vault cluster at
  `vault-cluster-public-vault-df29b16f.9b573ab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200`,
  namespace `admin`, KV v2 mount `secrets/`.
- A local install of the `vault` CLI:
  <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/install>
- The operator is responsible for running `vault login` themselves before
  any deploy script; minds never touches the user's Vault token.

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault-cluster-public-vault-df29b16f.9b573ab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200
export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
vault login -method=oidc   # or whatever your team is set up for
```

## Path layout

Secrets use a **split** layout: each `<service>` is a Vault *directory*, and
every logical key inside it is its own single-field leaf secret holding a
`value`. For example, the `litellm` service for the `ci` tier is laid out as:

```
secrets/minds/ci/litellm/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   -> { "value": "sk-ant-..." }
secrets/minds/ci/litellm/DATABASE_URL        -> { "value": "postgres://..." }
```

Read a single key with `vault kv get -mount=secrets minds/<tier>/<service>/<KEY>`
(the value is at `.data.data.value`), and list a service's keys with
`vault kv list -mount=secrets minds/<tier>/<service>`. The deploy code and
`push_vault_from_file.py` handle this fan-out for you.

Each tier has two families of Vault entries (each a service directory as
described above):

**Pushed to Modal at deploy time** (the connector + litellm-proxy read
these from their runtime env via `modal.Secret.from_name(...)`):

```
secrets/minds/<tier>/cloudflare
secrets/minds/<tier>/litellm
secrets/minds/<tier>/litellm-connector
secrets/minds/<tier>/neon
secrets/minds/<tier>/pool-ssh
secrets/minds/<tier>/supertokens
```

**Read only by `minds env deploy` on a developer's laptop** (never
pushed to Modal -- the connector's runtime doesn't need
create-project permissions):

```
secrets/minds/<tier>/neon-admin   # NEON_API_TOKEN (every tier);
                                  #   NEON_ORG_ID (dev only);
                                  #   NEON_PROJECT_ID (staging / production only)
```

**Sourced manually by the operator** (never pushed to Modal, never read
by `minds env deploy` -- no deployed service or deploy step makes
supplier API calls):

```
secrets/minds/<tier>/ovh          # OVH_APPLICATION_KEY, OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET,
                                  #   OVH_CONSUMER_KEY (shared per-tier bare-metal box
                                  #   supplier credentials, for `mngr imbue_cloud admin server`)
```

The dev-tier `neon-admin` token must have *project-create* scope on
the dev tier's Neon org (not just project-scoped permissions). Every
`minds env deploy` against a dev env creates a brand-new Neon
*project* named `minds-<env>` under `NEON_ORG_ID`, with `host_pool`
and `litellm_cost` databases inside; `minds env destroy` deletes the
project outright.

Staging / production keep a single tier-shared project each, named
by `NEON_PROJECT_ID` in the same Vault entry. The token there only
needs branch-create + restore scope on that project (a project-scoped
token is fine and preferable). `minds env deploy` snapshots the
project's default branch before mutating anything, and `minds env
recover` restores from that snapshot if the deploy fails -- without
`NEON_PROJECT_ID`, the deploy refuses to start because it can't be
rolled back. The actual runtime DSNs for these tiers live in
`secrets/minds/<tier>/neon` and `.../litellm` (the source of truth
for the connector + proxy at runtime).

The `ovh` entry holds the bare-metal box supplier credentials
(currently OVH). These order + manage the bare-metal boxes that Imbue
Cloud slices are carved on. The operator sources them into their shell
when running `mngr imbue_cloud admin server ...`; no deployed service or
`minds env deploy` / `destroy` step reads them. Generate the AK/AS/CK
trio at <https://api.us.ovhcloud.com/createApp> for the supplier
endpoint the pool uses (`ovh-us` by default). The shared per-tier
credential is intentionally account-wide so any operator can order +
manage boxes for the tier.

The schema for each `<service>` is the corresponding file under
`.minds/template/<service>.sh` at the repo root. `minds env deploy`
validates every key declared by a Modal-pushed template against the
Vault entry before pushing anything to Modal, so missing keys are
caught before they break a deploy.

`<tier>` is one of `dev`, `staging`, `production`. Per-dev-env secrets
(the values `minds env deploy` generates per developer for a dev env)
are **not** stored in Vault -- they live on the developer's machine
only in `~/.minds-<name>/secrets.toml` (mode 0600).

## Populating a tier

For each service, copy the template, fill in the values, and push:

```bash
cp .minds/template/litellm.sh /tmp/dev-litellm.sh
$EDITOR /tmp/dev-litellm.sh
uv run scripts/push_vault_from_file.py dev litellm /tmp/dev-litellm.sh
shred -u /tmp/dev-litellm.sh
```

The helper validates that every key declared by the template is present
in the filled file (empty values are fine -- the deploy step skips them
when pushing to Modal), pushes the entry, and prints a `shred` command
for cleanup.

## Deploying

All deploys (dev / staging / production) flow through the unified
`minds env deploy` CLI on the activated env:

```bash
# Tier deploys (staging / production):
eval "$(uv run minds env activate --deploy staging)"
uv run minds env deploy --yes-i-mean-staging

# Dev env deploys (per-developer):
eval "$(uv run minds env activate --deploy dev-<your-user>)"
uv run minds env deploy
```

(`--deploy` is required: `minds env deploy` refuses without it. See
`docs/environments.md` for the use-vs-deploy split.)

`minds env deploy` reads `apps/minds/imbue/minds/config/envs/<tier>/deploy.toml`
for the Modal workspace name + the list of services to push from
Vault, then runs `modal deploy` for both `llm-<tier>` and
`rsc-<tier>`. Tier deploys write nothing to disk
(the committed in-repo `client.toml` stays the source of truth); dev
env deploys write the resulting URLs to `~/.minds-<name>/client.toml`
and per-env secrets (Neon DSN, SuperTokens connection URI + API key)
to `~/.minds-<name>/secrets.toml` (mode 0600).

The `--yes-i-mean-<tier>` flag is a mandatory safety bar for tier
deploys. `minds env destroy` is dev-env-only and hard-refuses for
`production` / `staging` -- tier teardown is operator-managed outside
this CLI.

## Dynamic dev envs and Vault

`minds env deploy` (when run with a dev env activated) reads a small
set of dev-tier secrets from Vault (the dev-tier Neon API token and the
dev-tier SuperTokens admin key) to
provision per-dev-env resources. The resulting per-dev-env state
(Neon DSN, SuperTokens app id, etc.) is written **only** to
`~/.minds-<name>/secrets.toml` on the developer's machine -- never
back into Vault. Staging / production never write a local
`secrets.toml`; the same values for those tiers live in Vault and are
pushed straight to Modal on each deploy.
