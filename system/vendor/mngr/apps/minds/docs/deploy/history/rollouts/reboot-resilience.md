One-time operator runbook for deploying the two reboot-resilience fixes from
the August 2026 all-slices-down incident (production box `9ef5ab2e` /
147.135.97.121 was hard-reset; all 12 leased slice VMs stayed down ~19 hours
because nothing restarts them and users cannot self-recover):

1. **Box-level slice autostart** (mngr-internal#268): box prep now installs
   `mngr-slices-autostart.service`, which starts every stopped `mngr-slice-*`
   lima VM at box boot (bounded parallelism, visible failures). Prep also pins
   `Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false"` so a staged kernel can never
   reboot a box unannounced.
2. **In-VM volume-gated workspace autostart** (default-workspace-template#381,
   merged): `minds-autostart` is now triggered by a path unit watching a
   readiness marker that only ever exists on the mounted data volume, replacing
   the oneshot that raced the `/mngr-btrfs` mount and died of a start-rate
   limit (mngr-internal#266).

The two compose: the box unit brings the VMs up, the in-VM units bring each
workspace (container + services agent) up. A real reboot of the staging box
proved the box unit (all 4 slice VMs started with no hands) and a pre-merge
variant of the in-VM units (3 of 4 workspaces recovered hands-off; the 4th
exposed the premature-trigger failure that the merged #381 then fixed with
the mount-gated readiness marker).

Audience: an operator with production Vault access and an activated production
env (see [environments.md](../../reference/environments.md)). Deferred follow-ups (the
reconciler watchdog, reboot forensics, persistent journald) are tracked in
mngr-internal#333, not here.

## What is automatic vs. what you must do

Automatic once the code is released:

- Newly prepped boxes get the box unit and the apt pin (both live in
  `build_box_prep_script`).
- Newly baked slices get the volume-gated in-VM units (the installer lives in
  default-workspace-template's `.mngr/settings.toml` provider blocks and runs
  at host create).

Requires operator action:

- Re-running `just prep-server` on each existing production box (prep only
  runs when you run it).
- Backfilling the in-VM units on every existing slice VM (the installer only
  runs at host create, so the existing fleet keeps its old racy oneshot until
  backfilled). This was done via the since-removed `just backfill-autostart`
  sweep -- see Step 2.

Already done (during incident response and verification):

- Staging box `21ae4720` (15.204.52.75): box unit + apt pin installed via a
  real `prep-server` run; reboot-tested.
- Production box `9ef5ab2e`: apt pin only (hand-applied). It does NOT have the
  box unit; include it in the Step 1 sweep.
- The 4 staging VMs carry a hand-applied pre-merge variant of the in-VM units;
  include them in the Step 2 backfill so the fleet is uniform.

## Prerequisites

- mngr-internal#268 merged, and you are running from a checkout at or after it
  (the sweep uses your local `build_box_prep_script`).
- Production Vault token loaded and the env activated:
  `eval "$(uv run minds-admin env activate production)"` (see
  [vault.md](../../setup/vault.md)). No OVH supplier creds needed.

## Step 1: box sweep (box unit + apt pin)

For every `ready` box in `uv run minds-admin server list`:

```bash
just prep-server <server-id>
```

Prep is idempotent and safe on live boxes: the unit is enable-only (it never
starts during prep), starting already-running VMs is not part of its behavior
(it only starts *stopped* slices at boot), and running workspaces are
untouched.

**Note:** re-prep also applies any pending lima upgrade (the version-marker
guard in prep), so this sweep doubles as the lima 2.2.0 sweep from
[slice-hardening-rollout.md](slice-hardening.md) if that has not
been completed -- one pass covers both.

Verify per box (as `debian@<box-address>` with the pool key):

```bash
systemctl is-enabled mngr-slices-autostart.service   # -> enabled
sudo apt-config dump | grep Automatic-Reboot          # -> "false"
```

## Step 2: in-VM backfill (existing slices)

Every pre-#381 slice VM must have the merged installer content re-applied.
The merged installer block (in default-workspace-template `main`,
`.mngr/settings.toml`, the `post_host_create_outer_command__extend` of the
pool/slice provider blocks) is explicitly designed as the backfill path: it
removes the old direct enablement, revives units a past boot left dead of a
start-rate limit, writes the `.minds-volume-ready` marker behind a hard
`mountpoint` check, enables + starts the path unit, and explicitly fires the
service (`systemctl restart --no-block`) -- starting the path unit alone
never re-runs a service the old installer's boot-time oneshot left latched
active, which is exactly the state of a wedge-recovered VM.

The sweep that did this (`just backfill-autostart`, wrapping
`minds-admin server backfill-autostart`) has been removed now that the
fleet-wide backfill completed at minds-v0.3.17. For the record, it handled:

- **Per-generation services-agent script.** The installer's relaunch step
  probes the known in-container locations itself
  (`/home/user/workspace/system/scripts/minds_start_services_agent.sh`, then
  the older `/mngr/code/scripts/...`). A container that predates the script
  entirely (minds-v0.3.1) is started with its sshd brought up and a journal
  notice instead of failing -- a permanent failure would otherwise retrigger-loop
  the unthrottled path unit. Such VMs report `backfilled` with a
  container-start-only note in the JSON `detail`; their services agents
  relaunch via `mngr start` / the desktop client.
- **Reach.** VMs are only reachable via each box's lima user with the pool
  key (`limactl shell <instance> sudo ...`); the script should sweep
  box-by-box from `minds-admin server list` / `minds-admin pool list` data.
- **Idempotence and liveness.** Applying to a healthy running workspace must
  be a no-op for the user (`docker start` / `mngr start` are no-ops); the
  installer's own `mountpoint` guard makes it refuse to run on a VM whose
  data volume is not mounted -- treat that as a per-VM failure to
  investigate, not something to bypass.
- **Verification.** A VM only reports `backfilled` after the sweep observes
  a service run that started after the install and ended in success (unit
  state alone cannot tell a fresh success from the stale latched-active
  state) -- so a `backfilled: N, failed: 0` report means every workspace on
  the box actually started, and re-running the sweep is always safe.

No database migrations are needed for any of this: neither fix touches the
`pool_hosts` schema or the connector.

Verify per VM (the sweep checked all of this itself; for spot checks):

```bash
systemctl is-active minds-autostart.path        # -> active
test -f /mngr-btrfs/.minds-volume-ready && echo ok
```

## Step 3: fleet verification

- Spot-check a few boxes and VMs per the commands above.
- Optional but recommended: pick one lightly-used production box in a
  maintenance window, reboot it, and confirm every slice port comes back with
  no manual action (the staging reboot test took ~3.5 minutes to full
  recovery for 4 slices). Watch `journalctl -u mngr-slices-autostart` on the
  box and `journalctl -u minds-autostart` in a VM if anything lags.
- `just audit-boxes` afterwards to confirm occupancy matches expectations.

## If a workspace is still down after a box reboot

Re-running the merged in-VM installer on that VM is the supported recovery
(it revives dead units and re-fires the start). The installer text is the
`post_host_create_outer_command__extend` block of the pool/slice provider
templates in default-workspace-template's `.mngr/settings.toml` (the source
of truth). Apply it as root inside the VM through the box's lima user:

```bash
# installer.sh = the template block's script text, verbatim
ssh <lima-user>@<box-address> limactl shell --workdir / <instance-name> sudo bash -s < installer.sh
```

It is idempotent and safe on a healthy running workspace (`docker start` /
`mngr start` are no-ops), and it refuses to run while the VM's data volume is
not mounted -- investigate that rather than bypassing it. The box side is
`systemctl start mngr-slices-autostart.service` (idempotent; only starts
stopped slices). Slice data disks survive reboots intact, so recovery is
never data-destructive.
