# Workspace stop/start (imbue_cloud)

An imbue_cloud workspace can now be stopped without holding its bare-metal
slot: `mngr stop` halts the slice's lima VM, uploads its disks (encrypted)
to the tier's OVH Object Storage bucket, and lands the row on `stopped` the
moment the upload verifies; the halted local VM (and its slot) is kept
through the local-retention window for a fast restart in place, then reaped
by the supervisor's retention-finalize phase. `mngr start` restores the
workspace -- near-instantly on its origin box within the window, or by
downloading onto any same-region box with a free slot after it. The minds
desktop shows the Start/Stop control for imbue_cloud workspaces through the
same gate as local ones.

The pool_hosts row is the lease/machine record; `host_db_id` and `host_id`
identify the machine (the slice VM keeps its host id across stop/start --
suspending and resuming a machine does not mint a new one). The workspace's
own durable identity is its workspace id (the pre-provisioned services agent
id on the row). Lifecycle:

```
running (leased) -> stopping -> stopped -> starting -> running
```

- `stopping`: VM halted, upload in flight (the user sees STOPPING); a start
  is refused with 409 until the upload verifies -- transitions only begin
  from the stable states, so stop and start supervisors never coexist.
- `stopped`: artifact verified in the bucket. The halted local VM (and the
  slot, via the row's box link) is kept through the local-retention window
  so a start within it restarts in place; the retention finalize then
  deletes the VM and clears the placement, freeing the slot.
- `starting`: a connector supervisor is restoring/booting it; a failed
  start always lands back on `stopped` with the error recorded.
- `crashed`: operator-abandoned (`minds-admin workspaces abandon`);
  the user recovers by restoring the workspace's backup.

Beside the status, every stop stamps `stop_kind` with why it happened
(`specs/workspace-stop-kinds.md`): `owner` (the user's own stop, from any
device), `maintenance` (an operator hold -- the gen-2 migration; only an
operator start, or `minds-admin workspaces set-stop-kind <id> idle` on a row
the cutover has not parked, ends it; the owner's start answers 409
`workspace_under_maintenance` and the
desktop shows "Maintenance" with no Start control), `idle` (an operator stop
to free capacity -- `server drain`; the user starts it) or `suspension` (the
suspend fan-out; unsuspend rewrites it to `idle`). Every start clears it. The
desktop's unattended recovery never starts a cloud machine whose connector
status is `stopping`, `stopped` or `starting`: those states only come from a
requested stop.

## Moving parts

- **Connector** (`apps/remote_service_connector`): `GET /workspaces` (the
  full-lifecycle listing; `GET /hosts` stays leased-only and is deprecated),
  `POST /workspaces/{id}/stop|start` (async, 202 + poll), a per-transition
  Modal supervisor (0.25 CPU / 512MB) that drives the box-side scripts and
  finalizes DB state, and an hourly watchdog cron that *takes over* rows
  whose heartbeat went stale under a fresh `transition_id` fencing token
  (every supervisor write is guarded on it, so a superseded driver's writes
  hit zero rows). Re-drives back off exponentially in
  `transition_failure_count` and escalate to ops (error-level log) once a
  transition has clearly stopped converging; retries continue indefinitely,
  and abandoning a row is always a manual operator action.
- **Boxes**: prep installs pinned `age` + `s5cmd` plus apt `zstd`; transfers
  run as detached scripts (`zstd | age | s5cmd`) reporting through a status
  file. The
  boot-time slice autostart skips VMs carrying the stop-requested marker so
  a box reboot never resurrects a half-uploaded VM.
- **Artifact** (a machine image, not a workspace backup -- the restic
  backups remain the substrate-independent safety net): the slice's
  self-contained qcow2 `disk` + `datadisk`, plus a
  small metadata tar (`lima.yaml` and sidecars), keyed under
  `[<env>/]<host-id>/gen-<n>/`. Each object is encrypted to a per-stop age
  identity; the identity is wrapped by the tier KEK and stored on the row
  (committed *before* any byte uploads). Ciphertext sha256s live in the DB
  manifest and are verified before boot. Re-stops keep only the newest
  generation; destroy deletes the workspace's objects immediately (the
  restic backup's 30-day retention remains the safety net).
- **Quotas**: `max_remote_workspaces` caps *running* workspaces
  (leased/stopping/starting); the larger `max_total_workspaces` (free 5 /
  explorer 10 / ally 50) caps running + stopped. A just-stopped row counts as
  stopped even while its retained local VM still occupies a physical slot
  (pool capacity itself is enforced by real slot occupancy on the boxes).
  Stopping is always allowed; create checks both caps; start re-checks the
  running cap. Machine sizing adds two more (specs/slice-fleet):
  `max_active_machine_units` (units summed across running machines, a pending
  resize counted at its target) and `max_total_machine_disk_gb` (data-disk GB
  across running + stopped; the resize request is the grant point, since disk
  never changes at stop). Lowering a quota below usage refuses new
  grants/starts but never kills running machines.
- **Machine sizing at start** (gen-2; specs/slice-fleet): the start is what
  applies a pending resize. A restart-in-place re-checks the box's two
  budgets under the allocation lock, rewrites the env file at the target
  size, and grows the data-disk qcow2; when the origin box lacks room it
  falls back to the restore path, whose reserve renders the env at the
  target size on whichever candidate box fits (an explicit grow resizes the
  downloaded data disk before boot). When every candidate refuses for
  capacity, the restore destroys just enough unleased `available` pool rows
  (fewest-evictions box first, the eviction visible as `pool_rows_evicted`)
  and retries; when even eviction cannot fit the size, the start fails back
  to `stopped` with a "try a smaller size or try again later" error and the
  `machine_resize_placement_impossible` metric. A successful start restamps
  the row's current size and clears the targets; in-guest every-boot oneshots
  grow the data filesystem and re-cap the workspace container's memory, so no
  management-plane access into the guest is needed. Gen-2 stop uploads record
  the disks' measured qcow2 virtual sizes in the artifact manifest.

## Provisioning a tier (operator, once)

One bucket + one S3 user per tier. Dev envs share the dev tier's bucket --
the deploy stamps each env's `WORKSPACE_STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX=<env>/` override
automatically, so per-env artifacts (and their cleanup) stay disjoint.

1. Create an S3 user + credentials in the tier's OVH cloud project
   (`role=objectstore_operator`; `POST /cloud/project/<id>/user` then
   `POST .../user/<uid>/s3Credentials` via the OVH API, creds from the
   tier's `ovh` Vault entry).
2. Create the bucket (e.g. `mngr-workspaces-<tier>`) against the tier
   region's endpoint, e.g. `https://s3.us-east-va.io.cloud.ovh.us`
   (standard/`io` class; measured download from boxes ~1 GB/s).
3. Generate the KEK: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
4. Populate Vault from the template and deploy:

```bash
cp .minds/template/storage.sh /tmp/storage-<tier>.sh
$EDITOR /tmp/storage-<tier>.sh
uv run scripts/push_vault_from_file.py <tier> storage /tmp/storage-<tier>.sh
shred -u /tmp/storage-<tier>.sh
eval "$(uv run minds-admin env activate <tier>)"
uv run minds-admin env deploy --yes-i-mean-<tier>
```

`storage` is in every tier's `deploy.toml` services list, so the deploy
pushes it as the `storage-<env>` Modal secret the connector reads. A dev
env without the Vault entry populated still deploys (the deploy logs an
error and pushes a placeholder secret); the deployed connector then
cleanly refuses stop/start with a 503 until the entry is populated and
the env redeployed. Staging / production deploys hard-fail when the
entry is missing or misses template-declared keys -- push the entry
first (empty values are allowed to deliberately leave the feature
disabled). The dev tier's entry is populated (bucket
`mngr-workspaces-dev`).

A tier's `deploy.toml` may also declare a git-owned retention window
(`[storage] stop_retention_seconds`); the deploy stamps it as
`WORKSPACE_STOP_RETENTION_SECONDS` over the Vault entry, so git wins over
any stale Vault value. ci sets 60s and dev 300s so stop/start tests and
dev iteration see the retention finalize (slot freed, restore path
exercised) land in minutes; staging / production set 600s (since
2026-09-13; before that they kept the connector's default hour). The window
is a latency optimization only -- the row reaches `stopped` only after the
durable artifact is verified, and the finalize re-checks the manifest before
deleting the parked VM -- so it is sized for the stop-then-restart and
restart-for-resize flows, not for safety. Note that a `server drain` runs
the ordinary stop, and `cutover repave` refuses a box while any `stopped`
row still holds its box link, so the window is also the minimum wait between
draining a box and repaving it; supervisors already sleeping when the value
changes keep the window they started with.

## Operations

- `minds-admin workspaces start <host-db-id>` starts a `stopped` row on its
  owner's behalf (no ownership or quota check) -- the gen-2 cutover's
  pre-window step (see [gen2-cutover.md](../gen2-cutover.md)). While the
  cutover holds a gen-1 row parked (placement and artifact manifest both
  cleared), both the owner's and the operator's start answer 409
  `workspace_under_maintenance` (the parked-row guard's answer, the same
  detail the `maintenance` stop kind gives); the row comes back on its own
  when the cutover restores it.
- `minds-admin workspaces abandon <host-db-id> --reason ...`
  marks a row on a permanently dead box `crashed` (retries stop; the user
  restores from backup; artifacts are reclaimed at release). Releasing a
  crashed row attempts the VM teardown best-effort: an unreachable box is
  logged and the release still completes, and if the box was actually alive
  the leftover VM surfaces in the box-reconcile sweep.
- `minds-admin workspaces release <host-db-id>` runs the owner's exact
  destroy chain (stop artifacts deleted, slice VM destroyed, workspace
  record retired, row dropped) regardless of owner and in any lifecycle
  status -- including `stopped` rows, which `pool destroy` cannot claim --
  for a lease its owner confirmed abandoned. Idempotent: a row already gone
  reports `already_released`.
- A stuck transition is visible as a `stopping`/`starting` row (or a
  `stopped` row still holding its box link past the retention window) with
  a stale `transition_heartbeat_at` plus connector logs; the watchdog takes
  it over and re-drives it, backing off in `transition_failure_count` (the
  last failure is on `transition_error`) and logging at error level once it
  has failed many consecutive times.
- Restores on one box download one at a time under `~/.mngr-download.lock`
  (released before the VM boots). A restore queued behind another's
  download shows `STAGE=waiting-for-lock` in its box-side status file; the
  wait is bounded (`flock -w 300`), so a stuck lock fails the restore with
  `box download lock unavailable after 300s` on `transition_error` rather
  than stalling it. To find who holds the lock, walk `/proc/*/fd` for the
  lock path (not `/proc/locks`, which records the long-gone `flock(1)`
  pid); a `limactl hostagent` + `qemu` pair holding it is a leaked
  descriptor from a pre-fix restore, and unlinking the lock file (a new
  restore then locks a fresh inode) is the safe remediation.
- KEK rotation re-wraps the per-stop identities in the DB only -- objects
  are never re-encrypted.
- Known constraint: box uplink bandwidth is QoS-capped at the plan's
  1 Gbps, so a ~13 GB stop artifact uploads in about 2 minutes (download
  is ~1 GB/s). The historical 6-25 MB/s uploads (tens of minutes per
  stop) were the in-DC IPv6 path to the Object Storage VIP intermittently
  blackholing TCP flows (OVH ticket #723301): s5cmd preferred IPv6, and a
  blackholed flow stalls until the server kills it with RequestTimeout.
  Box prep (`bare_metal_prep.py`) now pins the S3 endpoints to their IPv4
  addresses in /etc/hosts, refreshed every minute by the
  `mngr-s3-ipv4-pin` systemd timer, which restores the full 1 Gbps.
  Content-addressed chunk dedupe (planned phase 2) remains the path to
  cutting uploads below the bandwidth cap by shipping only unique bytes.

## End-to-end verification

`apps/minds/deployment_tests/test_workspace_stop_start.py` runs the full
lease -> stop -> (upload, slot freed) -> start -> SSH-verified restore ->
release cycle against a real env; it skips cleanly when the env has no
baked slice or no storage configured. Run it against a dev env with a
baked box:

```bash
just minds-test-services-against dev-<you> apps/minds/deployment_tests/test_workspace_stop_start.py
```

(The test is in the `minds_services` batch, so it needs the
services-against runner pointed at a deployed env;
`minds-test-deployment-only` runs only the `minds_deployment` batch and
would deselect it.)
