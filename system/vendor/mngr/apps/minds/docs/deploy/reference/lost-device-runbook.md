# Lost-device runbook

What to do when a device that was signed in to a minds account is lost,
stolen, or otherwise no longer trusted.

A signed-in device may hold, on disk: the account's session tokens, the DEK
file (when the account was unlocked there), materialized workspace secrets
(restic backup envs, per-host SSH client keys, host-key pins), and lease
state for any cloud workspaces it created. Revocation is therefore three
steps, in this order: cut the account's sessions, re-wrap the key bundle,
then rotate every cloud workspace's SSH material so whatever the lost device
still holds stops opening anything.

## 1. Sign out all devices

Open the hosted account page (the connector's `/manage` surface) from any
browser and use **sign out of all devices**. This revokes every SuperTokens
session for the account -- the lost device can no longer call the connector:
no record pulls, no leases, no key minting, no shares.

What this does NOT do: it does not remove anything already on the lost
device's disk. Materialized SSH keys, pins, and backup envs remain readable
there, which is why the later steps exist.

## 2. Change the master password

From a healthy, unlocked device: minds settings -> change the master
password. The change is rewrap-only -- the account DEK is unchanged; a new
wrapped bundle is pushed to the connector -- so every synced secret stays
decryptable by your remaining devices with no re-encryption sweep.

Be aware of what rewrap-only means for the lost device: if the account was
unlocked there, that device holds the raw DEK file and can still decrypt any
record blobs it cached before its sessions were cut. The password change
stops a *thief who knows the old password* from unlocking on a *new* device;
it does not claw back material the lost device already has. Treat everything
that was materialized there as exposed, and proceed to step 3.

## 3. Rotate every cloud workspace

From a healthy signed-in device that has the workspace's key material on
disk -- the machine that leased it, or any unlocked device that has synced it
(the sync materializer writes the per-host key locally):

```bash
uv run mngr imbue_cloud hosts list
uv run mngr imbue_cloud hosts rotate <host-id|host-db-id|name>   # once per cloud workspace
```

`hosts rotate` rotates everything for the slice: the per-host SSH client key
(the old key is de-authorized on both endpoints only after the new one
provably authenticates) and both endpoints' sshd host keys, pinned
user-origin in the local host-key store, replacing the previous host keys
at those endpoints. minds' next sync pass detects the changed material and
re-pushes the workspace record; your other devices converge on the rotated
keys on their next pull (the synced pins replace theirs endpoint by
endpoint, so the previous host keys are retired there too). The lost
device's copies of the old client key stop opening the workspace the moment
the rotation completes.

## 4. Local workspaces on the lost device

Workspaces hosted *on* the lost device (docker / lima rows) are in the
thief's physical possession; there is nothing to revoke remotely. Their
synced records let you restore their data onto a new device from backups
(the record carries the restic env). If you consider the backups themselves
compromised -- the lost device holds their restic credentials too -- export
what you need, then destroy and re-create the affected workspaces so new
backup credentials are minted.

## Scope notes

- Stopped cloud workspaces: their uploaded disk artifacts are encrypted
  under operator-held keys, not device-held ones, so a lost device does not
  affect them (see the addendum in
  [security-boundaries-audit.md](../../security-boundaries-audit.md)).
- An operator cannot substitute for step 3: adoption means only the user's
  devices are the pinning authority, and devices refuse a host re-keyed by
  anyone else (see "adoption" in the [glossary](../../workspace/glossary.md)).
