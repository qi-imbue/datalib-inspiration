# Latchkey permissions

Minds-managed agents access third-party services (Slack, GitHub, Google Drive,
...) through [Latchkey](https://github.com/imbue-ai/latchkey). This page
describes how the desktop client surfaces permission decisions to the user
and how the agent receives the answer.

Every workspace sees exactly one gateway at the same loopback URL. Local
workspaces use the desktop-resident gateway. Remote workspaces use the
VPS-resident gateway for third-party calls; its bundled forwarding extension
proxies `/permissions`, `/permission-requests`, and `/minds-api-proxy` requests
back to the desktop gateway over an SSH tunnel. This keeps the permission queue,
permissions files, and Minds API on the user's computer without requiring a
second gateway URL or a different agent skill.

## End-to-end flow

1. **Agent makes a call.** The agent issues an HTTP request to the
   workspace's minds-managed `latchkey gateway` (or to `latchkey curl`
   directly). The agent's environment carries the gateway URL, a shared
   password (sent in `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password`) and a permissions
   override JWT (sent in `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override`) that
   points the gateway at the agent's own permissions file.
2. **Gateway responds with success, no-credentials, or not-permitted.**
   * 200: success, nothing to do.
   * 400 with `Error: No credentials found for <service>` (or `... are expired`):
     the user has not yet authenticated to the service.
   * 403 with `Error: Request not permitted by the user.`: the user has
     authenticated but has not allowed this kind of request.
3. **Agent files a request with the gateway.** On any of the blocked
   outcomes, the agent POSTs to the gateway's `/permission-requests`
   extension with the request type, its type-specific payload, and a
   one-paragraph rationale, then ends its turn and goes idle. The gateway
   persists the request in its own queue.
4. **The user opens the request.** The gateway's own persisted queue is
   the pending set: the desktop client reads it on demand (minus requests
   with a recorded verdict) and follows the gateway's stream only as a
   change signal. A pending request never opens anything by itself: it
   waits behind the chat card's "Review & respond" relay and the "Waiting
   on you" rows in a machine's Permissions tab.
   Either one opens the permission popup as a **centered dialog** over the
   current window, on a dim backdrop. The popup is the only review
   surface; the other ways in all lead back to it: the titlebar bell's
   notification feed (whose pending rows carry the request), its toast
   cards, and OS-notification clicks each jump to the asking workspace and
   open the same popup there. It is not a route -- it
   stacks over whatever is on screen, including the workspace-options panel
   -- so dismissing it via Approve/Deny, the close button, a backdrop
   click, or Escape returns the user to their work with nothing changed
   underneath.

   The popup shows one request at a time, headed by a "Permission request
   for [dot] <workspace>" eyebrow. Resolving it advances to the next
   pending request, and the popup dismisses itself when none remain; a
   request resolved on another surface advances the popup the same way.

   The page renders a single-scope permission dialog:
   * The dialog header is the service's brand mark in a rounded square
     followed by the service name plainly (no monospace pill). The asking
     machine is named once, in the popup's own "Permission request for
     <workspace>" eyebrow, so the dialog does not repeat it. Below the
     header sit the **Account** section (whenever anything is signed in,
     see below) and then the agent's rationale under a **Reason** heading.
   * By default the dialog shows a **simple, informative view**: a single
     summary heading ("Approving will let the agent") above a read-only
     list of what will be granted on Approve -- each permission in plain
     English, never its schema name -- plus only the Approve / Deny
     buttons. This keeps the common case approachable for non-technical
     users.
   * A small **"Adjust"** link, below the permission list and indented to
     its text column, reveals the full **editor view**, which exposes a
     switch per [Detent](https://github.com/imbue-ai/detent)
     permission schema available for that scope, grouped by the area it
     acts on. The available schemas are read from the bundled
     `services.json` catalog (shipped with mngr_latchkey) and cached in
     process for the lifetime of the desktop client. The selection lives in
     the dialog rather than in the markup, so the two views are the same
     set seen two ways and the simple view's Approve submits whatever the
     editor was left holding. A **"Back to agent's picks"** link above the
     editor returns to the summary and restores exactly the set the
     request arrived with, discarding whatever was changed in the editor.
   * The detent ``any`` schema (matches every request inside the scope)
     is the sole member of a trailing **Extras** group, behind a divider
     at the end of the editor, so the user can opt into unrestricted
     access without it reading as one more area of the service. It is
     **not** selected by default, and so never appears in the simple
     view's read-only list. Turning it on is exclusive: the specific
     switches gray out, and only the catch-all is submitted.
   * The dialog preselects (and the simple view lists) the union of (a)
     permissions already granted for that scope on the agent's host and
     (b) the permissions the agent declared in the request event.
     Approving without changes grants exactly that union; opening the
     editor and turning more on broadens it, turning them off narrows or
     revokes. The editor therefore doubles as a revocation UI.
   * The Approve button stays disabled while nothing is selected, so if
     the agent submitted an empty ``permissions`` tuple and the user has
     no prior grants for the scope, the simple view shows a prompt to use
     "Adjust" and the user must actively pick something there before
     approving.
6. **User approves.** The desktop client:
   1. Runs `latchkey services info <service>` to read `credentialStatus`,
      `authOptions`, and `setCredentialsExample` (the same call that
      rendered the dialog's account picker and, for a service with no
      browser sign-in, its credential form).
   2. If credentials are not `valid` and the service advertises a
      `browser` auth option (or latchkey reports no `authOptions` at all,
      treated as the legacy fallback), runs `latchkey auth browser <service>`
      synchronously (transparently running the one-off `latchkey auth
      browser-prepare <service>` step first when latchkey asks for it).
      Cancellation or failure of either step produces a `FAILED` outcome:
      the grant is **not** applied and the request stays pending (no
      response event is written), so the dialog surfaces the reason and the
      user can click Approve again to retry. A failed approval is never
      recorded as a denial.
   3. If credentials are not `valid` and the service does not advertise a
      `browser` auth option (e.g. AWS or Coolify, where `authOptions =
      ["set"]`), the grant is **refused for now** and the request stays
      pending while the dialog collects the credentials (see
      [Manual credential entry](#manual-credential-entry) below). Minds
      never asks the user to open a terminal.
   4. Atomically rewrites the agent's `latchkey_permissions.json` so the gateway
      enforces the chosen schemas on the next request.
   5. On success, appends a `GRANTED` response event to
      `~/.minds/events/requests/events.jsonl`. (A `FAILED` approval writes
      no response event and leaves the request pending; see step 6.2.)
   6. On a `GRANTED` outcome, sends the agent a plain-English `mngr message`
      describing the decision (with the request's id embedded, so the chat
      harness can pair the notice with the right card); the agent wakes up
      and decides whether to retry. Delivery is retried with backoff for as
      long as the app runs, so a nudge for a stopped workspace lands when
      that workspace next comes up; the in-chat card does not depend on it
      (see step 8). A `FAILED` or manual-credentials outcome leaves the
      request pending and notifies only the user (in the dialog), not the
      agent.
7. **User denies.** The desktop client appends a `DENIED` response event
   and sends the agent a plain-English denial message (same id embedding
   and retrying as the grant nudge). `latchkey_permissions.json` is not
   touched.
8. **The asking workspace hears the verdict at once.** Either resolution
   also sends the workspace a one-entry `minds:permission-resolutions`
   embed contract message (see `docs/embed-contract.md`), so its in-chat
   card flips to Approved/Denied without waiting for the agent's own
   resolution message to travel back through the transcript. It goes only
   to the workspace that asked, and only when that workspace is the one on
   screen -- the chrome mounts one workspace frame at a time, so no other
   workspace has a live page to update. A workspace page built AFTER the
   verdict (a reload, or returning to a workspace resolved while another
   was displayed) is covered by the snapshot: whenever the chrome (re)loads
   a frame it pushes that workspace's recent verdicts, read from the
   response event log via `/ui/api/inbox/resolutions`. Once the
   transcript's own classified resolution lands, it takes over.

## Creating a connection an agent asks for

Most third-party services come from Minds' shipped catalog. When an agent needs
a domain that catalog has no entry for, it can ask for the connection to be
*created*: it submits a `custom-service` permission request naming the domain
and, optionally, how the service signs in through a browser. One Approve both creates
the connection and grants the asking machine access to it.

The dialog is the simplest of the kinds, and deliberately so:

* It is headed by a globe and "Storing credentials for **the origin**" -- there is no display-name field
  on the request, here or on the wire. A custom service is labelled by its
  domain everywhere it is named, because that is the one string that cannot
  misdescribe what the connection reaches. The agent's rationale is the only
  agent-authored text on screen, and it appears under **Reason** as the agent's
  claim rather than as the app's description of the service.
* There is **no account picker**: the workspace's machine has no account for
  the service yet, whether the service is being created or this computer
  already has it, and the sign-in (or the typed credentials) establishes the
  one the grant rides on.
* There is **no permission editor and no "Adjust" link**: the grant is
  all-or-nothing on a scope already pinned to a single domain, so there is
  nothing to narrow.
* When the request carries a browser sign-in, the dialog names the URL the
  browser will open, and Approve reads "Sign in & approve".
* When it does not, credentials still have to be established -- "no sign-in
  flow" does not mean "no credentials", since Latchkey refuses a request to a
  registered service with nothing stored, so a domain with genuinely no
  authentication is not reachable this way. Unlike a catalog service, the form
  cannot be part of the first render: the service does not exist yet, so it has
  no credential command to build inputs from. The first Approve therefore
  registers it and comes back asking, and the second supplies the values -- the
  same two-step a catalog service falls into when its credentials turn out to
  need typing (see [Manual credential entry](#manual-credential-entry)). A
  rejected value re-shows the form with the reason, rather than failing the
  request.

Approving registers the service in Latchkey's own `config.json` unless this
computer already has it, connects an account on the workspace's machine, and
then writes the grant -- the account-scoped rule plus the scope's own
definition, since a custom scope is not a Detent builtin -- into the agent's
per-host permissions file through `POST /permissions/rules`, the same write a
predefined grant makes, and drops the gateway's pending record. The gateway's
`permission-requests` extension decides nothing about a custom service beyond
the shape of the request. A failure at any step leaves the request
**pending** with no response event, exactly as a failed predefined approval
does, so the user can fix the problem and click Approve again and the agent is
never told it was denied. Denying registers nothing and leaves no trace of the
proposed service.

A second workspace asking for an origin some earlier one connected is the
common case, not an error: its own gateway has no service for the origin, so
`custom-service` is the only request it can make. The dialog then says the
connection already exists on this computer and names the sign-in of the
registration this computer has -- the request's `login` counts only for a
service being created -- and approving connects that workspace to the service
as it is.

What the request may name is deliberately wide: a private network may call
its services whatever it likes, and the dialog shows exactly which origin is
being approved. The domain is a bare ASCII hostname -- dot-separated labels of
letters, digits and hyphens, so a single label, a private suffix or an IPv4
address are all fine, and a non-ASCII name arrives as its punycode -- with
three refusals: anything beyond a bare host (a scheme, port, path, underscore
or wildcard), a name longer than DNS allows, and the gateway's own address. The
request names the scheme, `https` or `http` -- the latter for a service on
a private network with no certificate; the dialog shows the resulting origin rather than the bare domain,
and says outright when it is plain http, since that is the difference between
credentials sent encrypted and in the clear. The grant pins both the domain and
the scheme, so it covers exactly the origin the dialog showed.

A browser sign-in is a `login` object described the way `latchkey services
register` takes it: `url`, `flow` (`cookie-capture` or `token-capture`) and
`flow_params`, the flow's own parameters keyed as latchkey keys them
(`cookieKeys`/`cookieUrl`, `tokenUrl`/`tokenField`/`header`); all three are
required inside it, and the object is omitted for a service with no browser
sign-in. It is not passed through blind: the gateway and the
desktop both deserialize the parameters against the flow's schema and refuse
an unknown key, and every URL among them -- the login page, `cookieUrl`,
`tokenUrl` -- may use either scheme but must be on the approved domain or a
subdomain of it, so where the browser goes and where the captured credentials
apply is always what the dialog named. What passes is registered exactly as
the agent sent it.

Some valid names still get a warning line in the dialog, in place of the old
hard refusals: a reserved name nothing answers to (`.invalid`, `.test`,
`.example`, `example.com` and its siblings, `.onion`), a name the workspace
machine's own network resolves (`localhost`, a single label, `.local`,
`.internal`, `.lan`, `.corp`, `.home`, `.home.arpa`), any IP address, and a
punycode label that could look like another site. The classification lives in
`custom_services.domain_warning` and is advisory: nothing is blocked, and the
line is worded as "make sure you know what this is", since a private network
calls its services what it likes.

An agent is not supposed to ask for a domain some *other* service already
covers, and does not need Minds to stop it: Latchkey answers that question
first. A request to a domain no service covers fails with `No service matches
URL`, and that is the only error the workspace's latchkey skill treats as
grounds for asking to create a connection; an error naming a service sends it
to an ordinary permission request instead. Were one to slip through anyway, the
duplicate is inert rather than dangerous -- Detent takes the first rule whose
scope matches, so the second never applies.

Once created, a custom service is an ordinary connection: it appears in the
Permissions tab and on the Connectors page with its account, and its access can
be revoked there. Latchkey re-reads its registrations on every request, so the
new service is usable immediately, with no gateway restart.

A remote workspace's machine keeps its own `config.json`, seeded from this
computer's when the machine was provisioned and never read back -- so a service
created afterwards exists only here until something carries it over. Every
connect does, the way the policy travels: the single script that merges the
credential into the machine's store first installs this computer's projection of
that file -- the hidden built-in services and every registered service, bundled
and custom -- as a whole snapshot, ahead of the credential, because a gateway
with no entry for a service cannot route a request to it. Nothing else on a
machine writes that file (upstream latchkey touches it only from `services
register` and from browser discovery, neither of which runs on a VPS), so the
newest snapshot is always right, and a service deregistered here disappears from
the machine on its next connect. The snapshot never includes this computer's own
browser or keyring settings. A custom service this computer has no registration
for is refused rather than pushed, since the machine could never use its
credentials.

## Manual credential entry

A service latchkey cannot sign in to through a browser advertises an
example of the command that stores its credentials, with each value the
user has to supply written as an angle-bracketed placeholder -- e.g.
`latchkey auth set-nocurl aws <access-key-id> <secret-access-key>`. Minds
parses that example (`imbue.mngr_latchkey.credential_commands`) and turns
it into **one labeled input per placeholder**, which the detail payload
carries (`manual_credentials`) so the dialog renders the form at the top
immediately -- no first Approve needed to discover that credentials are
required. Approve then substitutes the typed values, runs the command
itself with `--account <selected account>` (a global latchkey option, so
it precedes the subcommand) and Minds' own `LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY`, re-reads
`latchkey services info`, and continues the grant. One click, no terminal,
and the credentials land in the store the desktop client actually reads.

Details worth knowing:

* The command itself is **never shown**: it is an implementation detail,
  and the user only ever sees the values it needs. It is built as an argv
  list (no shell), so a pasted value is never re-interpreted, and the
  filled-in argv is never logged.

* The form belongs to the *selected account*: each account choice carries
  `is_credential_setup_needed`, so switching from a not-yet-connected
  account to a working one hides the form (and re-enables Approve) without
  a round trip. Approve stays disabled while any input is empty.

* The account the credentials are stored under is the one the dialog's
  **Account** dropdown selects. The dialog has two shapes, not three:
  with nothing signed in there is no dropdown at all and Approve reads
  "Sign in & approve", so the browser hop is not a surprise; with anything
  signed in -- one account or several -- the dropdown appears, the account
  the grant will ride on already selected and "+ Add account" last. A lone
  account is not a third arrangement: a service can hold several accounts,
  so a review that named none would leave which one unsaid. Choosing
  "+ Add account" flips Approve back to "Sign in & approve" and leaves the
  dropdown in place, so the choice can be taken back; nothing is signed in
  until Approve. A service with no accounts yet resolves to latchkey's
  unnamed default account; "+ Add account" on a service that already has
  one also asks for an **account name** (`is_account_name_needed`), since
  a manual connection cannot discover it the way a browser sign-in does.

* Two different things can go wrong, and they read differently:

  * The value is **malformed** -- the service's own shape check rejects it
    (`latchkey auth set-nocurl` exits non-zero, e.g. "doesn't look like an
    AWS access key ID"). Its explanation is surfaced verbatim, minus the
    usage lines latchkey appends: those either restate a terminal command
    Minds never shows or, for AWS, print the bare `<access-key-id>`
    placeholder as the "example", which is worse than nothing next to an
    input already labelled that way. `describe_credential_command_failure`
    does that trimming (and caps a crash dump).

  * The value is **well-formed but wrong** -- mistyped within the accepted
    shape, or revoked, rotated or expired. `auth set` only validates the
    shape, so these store fine and only fail when latchkey actually calls
    the service. Minds therefore re-reads the *online* `services info`
    after storing and refuses to grant unless the account's credentials
    come back usable. Note that a service Minds cannot reach reads the same
    way (latchkey reports any failed check as `invalid`), so the message
    names that possibility too. The credentials stay stored either way, so
    a later Approve re-checks them.

  In both cases the form comes back with the typed values intact and the
  reason in place of its instruction -- as the design system's `error`
  `Notice` (red, `role="alert"`), and scrolled into view with the smallest
  movement that shows it, since the form sits above a permission list that
  can leave it off-screen from where the Approve button is. The scroll is
  handed out once per failed approval, so later redraws never fight the
  user's own scrolling. An outright `FAILED` approval (a browser sign-in
  that did not complete) gets the same treatment on its own notice.

* If the example has no `<placeholder>` at all (or is not a latchkey
  invocation), there is nothing to ask for: the dialog shows that as an
  error and offers **no Approve button**, leaving Deny as the only action.

## Per-agent isolation

Minds runs a single shared `latchkey gateway` subprocess for every
agent rather than one per agent. The gateway is locked down with two
latchkey 2.8.0 features:

* **Password protection.** The gateway is started with
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD` set, so it rejects every request
  that does not present the same value in the
  `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password` header. The password is derived
  deterministically from the desktop client's Latchkey encryption key:
  minds calls `latchkey gateway create-jwt --no-validate` against a
  hard-coded sentinel path and SHA-256-hashes the resulting JWT. That
  way the password is stable across desktop-client restarts without
  minds having to persist it in plaintext anywhere.
* **Per-agent permissions.** When an agent is created, minds allocates an
  opaque `~/.minds/latchkey/permissions/<uuid>.json` handle and materializes it
  with the deny-by-default baseline. For a desktop-gateway workspace, minds
  mints a permissions-override JWT pointing at that handle and injects it as
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE` at `mngr create` time. For a
  VPS-gateway workspace, the environment omits that override: native requests
  use the VPS gateway's synchronized default `~/.latchkey/permissions.json`.
  Its desktop-forwarding extension holds a separate desktop-target JWT and
  replaces the override header only on requests it forwards.

  After `mngr create` returns the canonical agent id, minds replaces
  the opaque file with a symlink pointing at
  `~/.minds/agents/<agent_id>/latchkey_permissions.json`. The agent-id
  path is the canonical location -- the desktop client's permission-grant
  flow writes to it as before -- and the gateway reads through the
  symlink to see those grants. This indirection lets minds mint and
  inject the JWT before the agent id is known, eliminating a
  previously-fragile post-create injection step.

## Minds API access through the gateway

Minds itself exposes a small REST API on the desktop-client bare
origin (`/api/v1/...`: agent notifications, workspace view refresh,
and the WebDAV file-sharing mount). Agents reach it through the same latchkey
gateway they use for every other outbound HTTP call, via the bundled
`minds-api-proxy` extension at `/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/...`. There is
no per-agent reverse SSH tunnel for the Minds API anymore.

Authentication uses one central `MINDS_API_KEY` per `minds run`,
freshly generated in memory at startup and never handed to agents.
The `minds-api-proxy` extension reads it from the
`LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_KEY` env var (published to the supervisor
by `minds run`, which restarts the supervisor on every startup so the
current key always wins) and injects `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on
every forwarded request, overwriting any header the agent supplied.
The desktop client matches the same value on the inbound side. The
key rotates per minds startup; nothing else in the monorepo reads it
from disk, so there is no on-disk copy to keep in sync.

Three routes are *not* agent-scoped and are granted to every agent by the
baseline, because they are identical for all callers and carry no
per-workspace data: `GET /minds-api-proxy/api/schema` (the OpenAPI
description of the reachable surface), `GET
/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/timezone` (the IANA timezone of the machine the
desktop client runs on), and `GET /minds-api-proxy/api/v1/app/version`
(the newest workspace-template ref the app supports, which for a released
binary is also its own release tag). That last one is what a workspace's
`update-self` caps itself against, so it does not pull a template newer
than the app driving it. Note that this is self-imposed by the workspace,
not enforced here: nothing stops an agent that skips `resolve-target`, or
a user running `git merge` by hand. The threat model is a workspace
breaking itself by accident, not a hostile one. It is baseline-granted
rather than must-ask because update-self resolves its target from a
background worker, where a permission dialog has nobody to answer it.
Each of the three is pinned by `const` to its exact method and path, so
none of them widens to the rest of `/api/v1` -- note in particular that
the app grant pins `/app/version` and not `/app`, so it cannot widen to
whatever app state a later route hangs off that prefix.
Existing hosts pick a newly-added baseline grant up through
`reconcile_baseline_permissions`, which `register_agent_for_host` applies
whenever it registers a discovered agent -- a baseline addition alone
would otherwise only reach newly-created workspaces. A remote workspace's
gateway checks these grants against its *own* copy of the file, so a
registration that changes the file is also pushed to the workspace's
machine (see "Grants follow the same ownership" below). Reconciliation only
*adds permissions to the `latchkey-self` rule*; it never introduces a
rule, so a baseline addition shaped as a new rule reaches newly-created
host files only. Auto-registration de-dupes an agent it has already
registered for the life of the process, so a permission addition lands on
the first discovery after the app restarts, not mid-run. An agent still
waiting on its host file is the exception: it is retried on every
resolver change, so its registration (and the reconciliation that rides
along) does land mid-run.

Per-agent isolation comes from the latchkey gateway's permissions
file. The agent baseline grants the whole per-agent path prefix --
any method on `/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/agents/<agent_id>/...` -- but
only when `<agent_id>` is one the host has registered. Two baseline
rules produce that, and rule order matters because detent stops at the
first matching scope: `minds-api-proxy-per-agent-unauthorized` matches
the prefix for any *unregistered* agent id and resolves to an empty
permission list (an immediate reject), and the `latchkey-self` rule
behind it carries `minds-api-proxy-per-agent`, which allows the path.
Registration adds an agent id to the unauthorized *scope schema's*
`not.anyOf` list, lifting it out of the reject shortcut. It is driven off the
*discovery* stream, not agent creation, so it covers agents the
workspace creates for itself (chat, worktree, worker) as well as the
primary one minds creates. Because discovery can see a brand-new agent
before creation has linked the host's permissions file into place, a
registration with no file to write to is retried on later resolver
changes rather than dropped. A new `/api/v1/agents/<id>/*` route
therefore needs no permissions work.

The bug-report route (`POST .../agents/<...>/report`) is the one
exception: it sits in a rule *ahead* of the unauthorized gate, so it
works for a caller with no per-agent registration at all -- on host files
new enough to carry that rule. Reconciliation adds no rule to older ones,
where an unregistered caller's report still hits the gate.

Because the file is keyed per host, an agent on host A cannot reach the
API on behalf of an agent on host B: host A's permissions file does not
list B's agent id at all. Within a host the allowlist is shared, which
is what lets a sub-agent address its workspace's primary agent id (as
the refresh call does).

The gateway's *default* permissions config
(`~/.minds/latchkey_default_permissions.json`) is materialized with
empty `rules` too, so any request that somehow bypasses the JWT
mechanism still sees a deny-all gateway -- the implicit `allow all`
that latchkey applies when the file is missing must never be observable
by an agent.

`LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY` -- where credentials live -- is shared across all agents
on the same machine, and *only* those: the user's computer keeps one store for
its local workspaces, and each remote workspace's VPS has one of its own (see
[Per-machine credentials](#per-machine-credentials) below).

## Cross-workspace management API permissions

Minds exposes a cross-workspace management API (`/api/v1/workspaces/...`)
that lets an agent in one workspace act on *other* workspaces -- listing,
reading detail/version/backups, creating, destroying, starting/stopping,
exporting and managing backups, establishing SSH access, updating settings,
and recovering (health check / restart). It is
reached through the same `minds-api-proxy` extension and gated by a single
`minds-workspaces` detent scope with one named permission per verb
(`minds-workspaces-read`, `-create`, `-destroy`, `-lifecycle`,
`-backups-export`, `-backups-manage`, `-ssh`, `-update`,
`-recover`). Nothing is
pre-granted, so an agent's first cross-workspace call gets a 403 until the
user approves; the scope and verb schemas are not part of the agent baseline
at all -- they arrive, fully self-described, with the grant (see below).

This surface has its own permission-request type, distinct from the
`predefined` (service-catalog) and `file-sharing` types: an agent POSTs
`type=workspace` to the gateway's `permission-requests` extension with the
verbs it wants and -- for the verbs that act on a specific workspace -- the
`target_workspace_id` it wants to act on. The desktop client surfaces a
dialog with a checkbox per verb plus, when the request names a target
workspace, an all-vs-selected choice.

The verbs split on a **target axis**:

* `read` and `create` are all-or-nothing: a grant applies to every
  workspace (listing does not leak per-target data, and create takes no
  target).
* `destroy`, `lifecycle`, `backups-export`, `backups-manage`, `ssh`,
  `update`, and `recover` are *target-scoped*.
  A "selected" grant for one of these verbs mints a **uniquely-named
  per-target permission schema** (`minds-workspaces-<verb>-<target_id>`)
  whose path pins that single workspace; an "all workspaces" grant uses
  the broad schema keyed by the plain verb name (with a `[^/]+` id
  wildcard). Because each selected target is a distinct schema name,
  successive grants *accumulate* targets through the gateway's ordinary
  schema-by-name merge -- the same mechanism file-sharing uses for
  per-path schemas -- with no `anyOf` and no special merge logic.

The grant is applied exactly like file-sharing: the agent's request carries
a precomputed `effect` (a self-contained patch of the scope schema + the
verb schemas + the grant rule, computed in `permission_requests.mjs`'s
`computeWorkspaceEffect`), and the desktop client approves it via
`POST /permission-requests/approve/<id>`, which splices the effect into the
requesting agent's per-host `latchkey_permissions.json` (reached through its
opaque handle) and drops the pending record. The approve call sends an
override body (`{permissions, target_workspace_id}`) so the gateway
recomputes the effect from the user's dialog choices (the verb subset they
ticked and the all-vs-selected target). The scope schema is emitted on every
effect and merged by name, so a host file that has never seen the scope gets
it with the first grant -- no baseline entry or startup migration required.
The Python `mngr_latchkey.workspace_permissions` module holds only the
dialog-facing verb metadata; the schema construction lives in the gateway
extension.

## Service catalog

The catalog of latchkey services (display name + scope schema + the
permission schemas the dialog offers) lives alongside the latchkey
gateway extension at
[`libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/extensions/services.json`](../../../libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/extensions/services.json)
and is read directly at desktop-client runtime by
`imbue.mngr_latchkey.services_catalog.ServicesCatalog`. Each service maps
to a *list* of scope entries (a single service may expose more than one
detent scope).
Each entry has the shape:

* `scope` -- the detent scope schema the service owns; used as the rule
  key in `latchkey_permissions.json` and as the value the agent puts
  in its permission request's `scope` field.
* `display_name` -- human-readable label for the *scope*, shown in the
  dialog header (`GitHub (REST API)`).
* `service_display_name` -- label for the whole service (`GitHub`), for
  surfaces that name a connection rather than one of its scopes. Present
  only where it differs from `display_name`.
* `permissions` -- granular detent permission schemas the dialog offers
  as switches. The catch-all ``any`` schema is added client-side as an
  available option (the gateway file does not list it) at the head of
  this list, though the dialog offers it last, in its trailing Extras
  group; it is never preselected, but the user can opt into it
  explicitly.

The minds desktop client caches the response in-process on first access
so each request renders without re-fetching. To add a new builtin
service, edit `services.json` in the gateway extension package (see its
README); those schemas must already exist in detent.

## Additional (custom) services

Beyond detent's builtin catalog, minds ships a small hardcoded list of
*additional* services in
[`libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/additional_services.json`](../../../libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/additional_services.json).
Their catalog entries are folded into `services.json` by that package's
generator, so the dialog and the gateway extensions treat them exactly like a
builtin service. These are third-party services minds supports itself, using
three latchkey features:

* **Registration.** minds writes each additional service into the
  `registeredServices` block of latchkey's own `config.json` -- the same
  place `latchkey services register` would -- so latchkey can match the
  service's domain and inject the user's stored credentials for it. Every
  gateway that serves minds agents gets this: the desktop one (at
  `Latchkey.initialize()` and again at each gateway spawn) and each
  VPS-resident one (during remote provisioning, before its gateway starts).
  A VPS needs it as much as the desktop does -- the credentials
  synchronized to it are unusable by a gateway that cannot resolve a
  request to the service in the first place. Writing the config rather than
  shelling out to the CLI also means a definition that changes in a later
  release reaches installs that already carry the old one; `services
  register` refuses a name that already exists.
* **Browser sign-in (optional).** A service may name a login URL and one of
  latchkey's generic login flows, which is what `latchkey auth browser`
  then runs for it. `claude.ai` uses the `cookie-capture` flow: latchkey
  opens the claude.ai login page and stores the `sessionKey` session cookie
  as the credentials.
* **Self-shipped detent schemas, inlined into every permissions file.** A
  custom scope is not one of detent's builtin schemas, so each additional
  service ships its own scope schema (matching the service domain) plus a
  permission schema. Those schemas are written into every host's
  `latchkey_permissions.json` -- new files get them from the agent baseline,
  and existing files pick up changes the next time an agent is registered on
  the host. Granting an additional-service scope is then a plain rule write
  against a file that already defines the scope. Keeping them in one shared
  file that host files pull in through detent's
  [`include`](https://github.com/imbue-ai/detent) directive does not work here:
  detent resolves a bare include relative to the referencing file's own
  directory, and a host's permissions file is read through several of them
  (its canonical `hosts/<host_id>/` path, the opaque handle a desktop
  workspace's JWT names, and `~/.latchkey/permissions.json` on a VPS), so the
  shared file would have to be copied next to each -- and an include that fails
  to resolve fails the whole permission check for that host.

Additional services are merged into the same catalog the dialog reads, so
they appear and are granted exactly like builtin ones. The seed entry is
`claude.ai`, which exposes a single `everything` permission (full access
to the `claude.ai` domain) and signs in through the browser like any other
service. An additional service that ships without a browser sign-in is
authenticated by hand instead, with `latchkey auth set <name> -H "..."`;
either way, granting the permission and supplying credentials are
independent steps.

## Per-machine credentials

Credentials belong to the machine that uses them. The user's computer keeps one
latchkey store, shared by every local workspace; each remote workspace's VPS
keeps its own, and is the only holder of its own refresh tokens -- which is what
lets it renew them while the user's computer is offline, without two machines
racing to rotate the same one.

Changes travel as operations, made at the moment the user asks for them:
connecting a service signs in here (the browser and the shared session are
here) and then hands the credential to the machine; disconnecting clears it on
the machine, because that is where it is.

Every change is carried **synchronously**, by the app itself: it loads mngr's
provider set in-process, opens the workspace's outer host (its VPS) and hands
the machine the change in a single remote command, blocking the click that
asked for it until the machine has taken it (`desktop_client/latchkey/`:
`machine_access.py` opens the door, `machine_operations.py` is what goes
through it). Nothing is queued and nothing is applied later, so what the UI
shows afterwards is what the machine holds -- and a change the machine will
not take is reported where the user clicked, immediately, rather than as a
notification about a click they have long since forgotten.

The provider set is loaded once, lazily, and kept for the life of the app;
loading it imports every installed provider plugin, so it is started on a
background thread at startup and the first Permissions tab open normally finds
it done.

The desktop keeps each remote machine's credentials in that host's *machine
store* (`~/.minds/latchkey/mngr_latchkey/hosts/<host_id>/`), a
`LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY` of its own that shares this computer's config, browser
session and encryption key. Everything the app does on a workspace's behalf --
listing its connections, signing in, entering credentials, signing out -- goes
through the store belonging to *that machine*
(`desktop_client/latchkey/machine_latchkey.py` decides which one that is), so a
sign-in for one machine never turns up in another's connectors. What ships to a
VPS is re-encrypted with that machine's own key on the way out.

Two consequences the UI makes visible:

* **Connecting a service is per machine.** A service connected on this computer
  is not connected for a remote workspace: its Permissions tab offers it under
  Add connection, and connecting it there runs the sign-in for that machine.
  The browser still opens here (there is nothing to open on a VPS) and reuses
  this computer's session, so it is usually a consent click rather than a full
  login.
* **Sign out reaches as far as the credential is shared.** Disconnecting an
  account from a machine's Permissions tab clears the credential of the store
  *that machine* reads and strips *that machine's* now-inert grants. A remote
  machine holds its own, so the same account keeps working everywhere else; this
  computer's store is shared by every local machine, so signing out from one of
  those signs out of all of them. The tab says which of the two it is before it
  asks to confirm.

A workspace whose gateway has not been provisioned yet has no machine of its own
to speak of, so it is answered from this computer's store until it has one.

Grants follow the same ownership, and travel the same way. A machine's
`~/.latchkey/permissions.json` is the policy it enforces, and every permission
edit made here is pushed to the machine as a full snapshot of the host's
canonical file. The permission dialog's Approve carries the credential and the
snapshot as **one change** (applied credential-first on the machine, failed
together), so neither half of a grant can land without the other; a toggle, a
revoke, a sign-out cleanup, and the grants that go through the gateway's own
approve endpoint (cross-workspace access, file sharing, accounts) each push a
plain snapshot. A machine that will not take one fails the action that asked
for it: the toggle stays where it was with the reason beside it, and the
dialog's Approve reports FAILED and leaves its request pending for a retry --
because it is not a grant until the gateway the agent talks to can act on it.

**Reading is symmetrical.** Opening (or refreshing) a remote workspace's
Permissions tab reads that machine first -- its credential store, re-encrypted
for this computer, and the policy its gateway is enforcing, both in one remote
command -- so the pane shows what its agents actually have rather than what
this computer last wrote toward it. A machine that cannot be reached shows as
"permissions can't be loaded", never as a stale answer presented as current.

The two halves reconcile differently on that read, because they are owned
differently. The **credentials are the machine's**: only it can rotate the
tokens it holds, so what it reports is adopted, and this computer's copy goes
back to matching it (which is also how a second computer sees an account the
first one connected). The **policy is the machine's too**, for a different
reason: the user may have several computers, and any of them can push a grant,
so a computer that treated its own copy as the truth would revert what another
one granted every time the tab was opened. The machine's answer is therefore
adopted here as well, and the copy here is a cache -- which is also what walks
back an edit whose push failed, with no separate error reconcile. That is only
safe because the copy here is never edited *without* being pushed in the same
breath: the UI's edits while the user waits, and the discovery-driven ones (an
agent registration, the baseline reconciliation that rides along with it) from
a background thread, coalesced per host, since the resolver callback they run
in must not block. An edit that could not be pushed is discarded by the next
read rather than carried over later, so a writer that cannot push has to say
so.

The one write that read makes *toward* the machine is the seed: a machine with
no policy at all permits everything, so it is handed this computer's copy
instead of being left open. Provisioning seeds it too, before any of this: the
pass that stands the gateway up writes the host's policy (or the deny-all
default) alongside it rather than waiting for someone to open the tab.

## Permissions tab (per machine)

The workspace options panel's **Permissions** tab is where connectors and
grants live, and the only place they live: each machine holds its own
credentials, so there is nothing an app-level page could say about them that
would be true of every machine at once. It owns both halves for one machine --
which accounts it is connected to, and what its agents may reach with them. It renders every permission that machine's
host file can carry as a toggle, so the file is editable without going
back through a request.

The left nav has one entry per **connection** -- a (service, account) pair
that either has stored credentials or still appears in the host's rules,
so a grant left behind by a disconnected account is never invisible --
plus **Add connection**, **Local files** (the `minds-file-server-*`
shared-path grants) and **Other machines** (the `minds-workspaces-*`
verbs). A "Waiting on you" strip leads the pane when this machine's agents
have pending requests; each row opens the review popup on that request.

Three properties are worth knowing:

* **A flip posts one permission, and the server answers with the whole
  view -- once the machine has taken it.** Every write blocks on the
  workspace's own machine, so the pane locks while one is in flight: the
  control that was clicked shows a spinner and every other action grays
  out (two writes at once would fight over the view each of them answers
  with). The client sends only the permission it flipped and its new
  state; the desktop client reads the host's permissions file, recomputes
  the affected rule's *complete* permission set, and writes that through
  the gateway's `permissions` extension -- never a diff. Recomputing
  server-side is what keeps a buggy or hostile client from clobbering the
  baseline permissions that share the `latchkey-self` rule with the
  toggleable ones. The response is the refreshed view, adopted verbatim,
  so the pane shows what was stored rather than what it hoped for; a
  refused write leaves the screen exactly as it was, with the reason
  beside the row. Turning a connector rule's last permission off deletes
  the rule rather than leaving an empty one behind.

* **Add connection connects a service two ways**, because latchkey does:
  the browser sign-in for the services that have one, and -- for AWS,
  Coolify and the like -- a form with one input per value the service's
  own `setCredentialsExample` asks for, stored by running that command
  (see [Manual credential entry](#manual-credential-entry)). Which of the
  two travels with each offered service, so the pane never offers a
  sign-in that cannot happen. Either way the new account arrives with
  nothing granted.

* **Revoke all and Sign out are different, but both are this machine's.**
  *Revoke all*, in a connection's heading, drops that account's grants and
  leaves the account connected -- so re-granting later is a click rather than a
  fresh sign-in. *Sign out*, at the foot of the panel, clears the stored
  credential itself, so this machine's grants for it -- which would otherwise
  have nothing behind them -- are stripped too. Revoke all never reaches past
  this machine; sign out reaches as far as that credential is shared (this
  machine alone when it holds its own, every machine on this computer when it
  reads the desktop's store), and its copy says which. Sign out asks first,
  naming the service and account.

  Nothing else removes a credential from a machine. A machine only ever holds
  what was connected for it, so an account with no grants is not something that
  leaked there and needs cleaning up -- it is one the user connected and has not
  signed out of. An account with leftover
  grants but no stored credential offers no Sign out -- there is nothing
  left to clear -- and its toggles can be turned off but not on, since
  turning one on would grant something with no credentials behind it.

Re-enabling a `latchkey-self` toggle needs the permission's schema
definition to still be in the host file -- detent fails the whole check on
a reference it cannot resolve. Revoking leaves the definition there
precisely so the row can be turned back on. A grant whose definition has
gone can still be turned off, but not back on: only the agent asking again
brings it back.

The pane loads independently of the panel's other tabs. A latchkey gateway
that cannot be reached shows as "permissions can't be loaded" rather than
an empty, misleading "nothing granted", and does not take Share machine or
Machine settings down with it.

## Agent-side responsibilities

Agents are expected to:

* Detect the three blocked outcomes from the gateway response.
* POST a permission request to the gateway's `permission-requests`
  extension (`POST /permission-requests` with `scope`, `permissions`,
  and `rationale`) -- or, for a domain the catalog has no service for, a
  `custom-service` request naming the domain (see [Creating a connection an
  agent asks for](#creating-a-connection-an-agent-asks-for)).
* Stop the turn and wait. The agent will receive an `mngr message` from
  the desktop with the decision and can decide whether to retry.

The detection-and-wait logic for Claude Code lives in the
`default-workspace-template` repository's latchkey skill, not in this
monorepo.
