# Latchkey permissions

Minds-managed agents access third-party services (Slack, GitHub, Google Drive,
...) through [Latchkey](https://github.com/imbue-ai/latchkey). This page
describes how the desktop client surfaces permission decisions to the user
and how the agent receives the answer.

## End-to-end flow

1. **Agent makes a call.** The agent issues an HTTP request to the
   minds-managed shared `latchkey gateway` (or to `latchkey curl`
   directly). The agent's environment carries the gateway URL, a shared
   password (sent in `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password`) and a permissions
   override JWT (sent in `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override`) that
   points the gateway at the agent's own permissions file.
2. **Gateway responds with success, no-credentials, or not-permitted.**
   * 200: success, nothing to do.
   * 400 with `Error: No credentials found for <service>` (or `... are expired`):
     the user has not yet authenticated to the service.
   * 403 with `Error: Request not permitted by the user.`: the user has
     authenticated but has not allowed this kind of request.
3. **Agent writes a request event.** On any of the blocked outcomes, the
   agent appends a `LatchkeyPredefinedPermissionRequestEvent` to
   `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR/events/requests/events.jsonl` with the latchkey
   service name and a one-paragraph rationale, then ends its turn and goes
   idle.
4. **Desktop notifies the user.** The desktop client tails the agent's
   request events file via `mngr event --follow`, adds a card to the
   inbox drawer, and surfaces a notification.
5. **User opens the dialog.** Clicking the card opens
   `/inbox?selected=<event_id>` in a **modal overlay** over the current
   window (a transparent full-window `WebContentsView` stacked above the
   workspace, with a dim backdrop). The user's workspace view is never
   navigated away, so dismissing the dialog -- via Approve/Deny, the close
   button, a backdrop click, or Escape -- returns them to their work with
   no context lost. (Opened directly in a browser, with no modal host, the
   page degrades to a dimmed, centered card and dismissal navigates home.)

   When the inbox was opened for a **single request** -- a notification
   click, a workspace relay, or auto-open on a new request -- resolving
   it via Approve/Deny dismisses the whole window. This is the default;
   it prevents an unrelated, stale request from another agent suddenly
   becoming visible after the user acts. Only when the user
   **intentionally opens the whole inbox** via the Requests button (which
   loads `/inbox?keep_open=1`) does resolving a request advance to the
   next pending one instead of closing the window.

   The page renders a single-scope permission dialog:
   * The dialog header names the service plainly (no monospace pill) and
     attributes the agent's rationale prominently as
     "`<workspace>` says:" -- this is the main place the requesting
     agent's name is surfaced. There is no separate "Workspace:" line.
   * By default the dialog shows a **simple, informative view**: a
     single summary sentence ("Approving will grant `<workspace>` and its
     sibling agents the following permissions:") above a read-only list
     of the permissions that will be granted on Approve (no checkboxes),
     plus only the Approve / Deny buttons. This keeps the common case
     approachable for non-technical users.
   * A small **"Adjust"** link, rendered inside the permission list, reveals
     the full **editor view**, which exposes a checkbox per [Detent](https://github.com/imbue-ai/detent)
     permission schema available for that scope. The available schemas
     are read from the bundled `services.json` catalog (shipped with
     mngr_latchkey) and cached in process for the lifetime of the desktop
     client. The checkbox inputs always exist in the page (the editor is
     merely hidden by default), so the simple view's Approve still
     submits the pre-checked set.
   * The detent ``any`` schema (matches every request inside the scope) is
     prepended as the first checkbox in the editor so the user can opt
     into unrestricted access if they want. It is **not** pre-checked,
     and so never appears in the simple view's read-only list.
   * The dialog pre-checks (and the simple view lists) the union of (a)
     permissions already granted for that scope on the agent's host and
     (b) the permissions the agent declared in the request event.
     Approving without changes grants exactly that union; opening the
     editor and ticking more broadens it, unticking narrows or revokes.
     The editor therefore doubles as a revocation UI.
   * The Approve button stays disabled while zero boxes are checked,
     so if the agent submitted an empty ``permissions`` tuple and the
     user has no prior grants for the scope, the simple view shows a
     prompt to use "Adjust" and the user must actively pick something
     there before approving.
6. **User approves.** The desktop client:
   1. Runs `latchkey services info <service>` to read `credentialStatus`,
      `authOptions`, and `setCredentialsExample`.
   2. If credentials are not `valid` and the service advertises a
      `browser` auth option (or latchkey reports no `authOptions` at all,
      treated as the legacy fallback), runs `latchkey auth browser <service>`
      synchronously (transparently running the one-off `latchkey auth
      browser-prepare <service>` step first when latchkey asks for it).
      Cancellation or failure of either step produces a `FAILED` outcome:
      the grant is **not** applied and the request stays pending (no
      response event is written), so the dialog surfaces the reason and the
      user can click Approve again to retry. A failed approval is never
      recorded as a denial.
   3. If credentials are not `valid` and the service does not advertise a
      `browser` auth option (e.g. Coolify, where `authOptions = ["set"]`),
      the grant is **refused** and the request stays pending. The dialog
      shows the `setCredentialsExample` returned by latchkey (or a
      generic fallback) and asks the user to run it in a terminal. A
      subsequent Approve click re-runs `latchkey services info` and
      proceeds normally once credentials are valid.
   4. Atomically rewrites the agent's `latchkey_permissions.json` so the gateway
      enforces the chosen schemas on the next request.
   5. On success, appends a `GRANTED` response event to
      `~/.minds/events/requests/events.jsonl`. (A `FAILED` approval writes
      no response event and leaves the request pending; see step 6.2.)
   6. On a `GRANTED` outcome, sends the agent a plain-English `mngr message`
      describing the decision; the agent wakes up and decides whether to
      retry. A `FAILED` or manual-credentials outcome leaves the request
      pending and notifies only the user (in the dialog), not the agent.
7. **User denies.** The desktop client appends a `DENIED` response event
   and sends the agent a plain-English denial message. `latchkey_permissions.json`
   is not touched.

## Per-agent isolation

Minds runs a single shared `latchkey gateway` subprocess for every
agent rather than one per agent. The gateway is locked down with two
latchkey 2.8.0 features:

* **Password protection.** The gateway is started with
  `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_LISTEN_PASSWORD` set, so it rejects every request
  that does not present the same value in the
  `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Password` header. The password is derived
  deterministically from the desktop client's Latchkey encryption key:
  minds calls `latchkey gateway create-jwt --no-validate` against a
  hard-coded sentinel path and SHA-256-hashes the resulting JWT. That
  way the password is stable across desktop-client restarts without
  minds having to persist it in plaintext anywhere.
* **Per-agent permission overrides.** When an agent is created, minds
  allocates an opaque
  `~/.minds/latchkey/permissions/<uuid>.json` handle, materializes it
  with empty `rules` (deny-all baseline), and mints a
  permissions-override JWT pointing at that path via
  `latchkey gateway create-jwt`. The JWT is injected into the agent's
  environment as `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE` *at*
  `mngr create` *time*, so the agent's first ever `latchkey` call
  already carries it in the
  `X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override` header.

  After `mngr create` returns the canonical agent id, minds replaces
  the opaque file with a symlink pointing at
  `~/.minds/agents/<agent_id>/latchkey_permissions.json`. The agent-id
  path is the canonical location -- the desktop client's permission-grant
  flow writes to it as before -- and the gateway reads through the
  symlink to see those grants. This indirection lets minds mint and
  inject the JWT before the agent id is known, eliminating a
  previously-fragile post-create injection step.

## Minds API access through the gateway

Minds itself exposes a small REST API on the desktop-client bare
origin (`/api/v1/...`: agent notifications and the WebDAV
file-sharing mount). Agents reach it through the same latchkey
gateway they use for every other outbound HTTP call, via the bundled
`minds-api-proxy` extension at `/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/...`. There is
no per-agent reverse SSH tunnel for the Minds API anymore.

Authentication uses one central `MINDS_API_KEY` per `minds run`,
freshly generated in memory at startup and never handed to agents.
The `minds-api-proxy` extension reads it from the
`LATCHKEY_EXTENSION_MINDS_API_KEY` env var (published to the supervisor
by `minds run`, which restarts the supervisor on every startup so the
current key always wins) and injects `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on
every forwarded request, overwriting any header the agent supplied.
The desktop client matches the same value on the inbound side. The
key rotates per minds startup; nothing else in the monorepo reads it
from disk, so there is no on-disk copy to keep in sync.

Three routes are *not* agent-scoped and are granted to every agent by the
baseline, because they are identical for all callers and carry no
per-workspace data: `GET /minds-api-proxy/api/schema` (the OpenAPI
description of the reachable surface), `GET
/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/timezone` (the IANA timezone of the machine the
desktop client runs on), and `GET /minds-api-proxy/api/v1/app/version`
(the newest workspace-template ref the app supports, which for a released
binary is also its own release tag). That last one is what a workspace's
`update-self` caps itself against, so it does not pull a template newer
than the app driving it. Note that this is self-imposed by the workspace,
not enforced here: nothing stops an agent that skips `resolve-target`, or
a user running `git merge` by hand. The threat model is a workspace
breaking itself by accident, not a hostile one. It is baseline-granted
rather than must-ask because update-self resolves its target from a
background worker, where a permission dialog has nobody to answer it.
Each of the three is pinned by `const` to its exact method and path, so
none of them widens to the rest of `/api/v1` -- note in particular that
the app grant pins `/app/version` and not `/app`, so it cannot widen to
whatever app state a later route hangs off that prefix.
Existing hosts pick a newly-added baseline grant up through
`reconcile_baseline_permissions`, which `register_agent_for_host` applies
whenever it registers a discovered agent -- a baseline addition alone
would otherwise only reach newly-created workspaces. Auto-registration
de-dupes per `(host, agent)` pair for the life of the process, so a
baseline addition lands on the first discovery after the app restarts,
not mid-run.

Per-agent isolation comes from the latchkey gateway's permissions
file. The agent baseline grants every agent one shared call --
`POST /minds-api-proxy/api/v1/agents/<...>/notifications` -- so any
workspace the desktop client created can always notify the user. For
the other routes (future `/api/v1/agents/<id>/*` endpoints,
the WebDAV mount), agent creation installs a *per-agent* rule + inline
schemas in the host's permissions file: the scope schema
`minds-api-self-<agent_id>` mirrors `latchkey-self.invalid` and the
permission schema `minds-api-proxy-call-<agent_id>` pins the URL
path to `/minds-api-proxy/api/v1/agents/<agent_id>/...`. Because the
file is keyed per host, an agent on host A cannot reach the API on
behalf of an agent on host B: host A's permissions file does not list
B's agent id at all.

The gateway's *default* permissions config
(`~/.minds/latchkey_default_permissions.json`) is materialized with
empty `rules` too, so any request that somehow bypasses the JWT
mechanism still sees a deny-all gateway -- the implicit `allow all`
that latchkey applies when the file is missing must never be observable
by an agent.

`LATCHKEY_DIRECTORY` -- where credentials live -- stays shared across all
agents on the same machine.

## Cross-workspace management API permissions

Minds exposes a cross-workspace management API (`/api/v1/workspaces/...`)
that lets an agent in one workspace act on *other* workspaces -- listing,
reading detail/version/backups, creating, destroying, starting/stopping,
exporting and managing backups, establishing SSH access, updating settings,
recovering (health check / restart), and managing service sharing. It is
reached through the same `minds-api-proxy` extension and gated by a single
`minds-workspaces` detent scope with one named permission per verb
(`minds-workspaces-read`, `-create`, `-destroy`, `-lifecycle`,
`-backups-export`, `-backups-manage`, `-ssh`, `-update`, `-recover`,
`-sharing`). Nothing is
pre-granted, so an agent's first cross-workspace call gets a 403 until the
user approves; the scope and verb schemas are not part of the agent baseline
at all -- they arrive, fully self-described, with the grant (see below).

This surface has its own permission-request type, distinct from the
`predefined` (service-catalog) and `file-sharing` types: an agent POSTs
`type=workspace` to the gateway's `permission-requests` extension with the
verbs it wants and -- for the verbs that act on a specific workspace -- the
`target_workspace_id` it wants to act on. The desktop client surfaces a
dialog with a checkbox per verb plus, when the request names a target
workspace, an all-vs-selected choice.

The verbs split on a **target axis**:

* `read` and `create` are all-or-nothing: a grant applies to every
  workspace (listing does not leak per-target data, and create takes no
  target).
* `destroy`, `lifecycle`, `backups-export`, `backups-manage`, `ssh`,
  `update`, `recover`, and `sharing` are *target-scoped*.
  A "selected" grant for one of these verbs mints a **uniquely-named
  per-target permission schema** (`minds-workspaces-<verb>-<target_id>`)
  whose path pins that single workspace; an "all workspaces" grant uses
  the broad schema keyed by the plain verb name (with a `[^/]+` id
  wildcard). Because each selected target is a distinct schema name,
  successive grants *accumulate* targets through the gateway's ordinary
  schema-by-name merge -- the same mechanism file-sharing uses for
  per-path schemas -- with no `anyOf` and no special merge logic.

The grant is applied exactly like file-sharing: the agent's request carries
a precomputed `effect` (a self-contained patch of the scope schema + the
verb schemas + the grant rule, computed in `permission_requests.mjs`'s
`computeWorkspaceEffect`), and the desktop client approves it via
`POST /permission-requests/approve/<id>`, which splices the effect into the
requesting agent's per-host `latchkey_permissions.json` (reached through its
opaque handle) and drops the pending record. The approve call sends an
override body (`{permissions, target_workspace_id}`) so the gateway
recomputes the effect from the user's dialog choices (the verb subset they
ticked and the all-vs-selected target). The scope schema is emitted on every
effect and merged by name, so a host file that has never seen the scope gets
it with the first grant -- no baseline entry or startup migration required.
The Python `mngr_latchkey.workspace_permissions` module holds only the
dialog-facing verb metadata; the schema construction lives in the gateway
extension.

## Service catalog

The catalog of latchkey services (display name + scope schema + the
permission schemas the dialog offers) lives alongside the latchkey
gateway extension at
[`libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/extensions/services.json`](../../../libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/extensions/services.json)
and is read directly at desktop-client runtime by
`imbue.mngr_latchkey.services_catalog.ServicesCatalog`. Each service maps
to a *list* of scope entries (a single service may expose more than one
detent scope).
Each entry has the shape:

* `scope` -- the detent scope schema the service owns; used as the rule
  key in `latchkey_permissions.json` and as the value the agent puts
  in its permission request's `scope` field.
* `display_name` -- human-readable label shown in the dialog header.
* `permissions` -- granular detent permission schemas the dialog offers
  as checkboxes. The catch-all ``any`` schema is prepended client-side
  as an available option (the gateway file does not list it); the
  dialog never pre-checks it, but the user can opt into it explicitly.

The minds desktop client caches the response in-process on first access
so each request renders without re-fetching. To add a new builtin
service, edit `services.json` in the gateway extension package (see its
README); those schemas must already exist in detent.

## Additional (custom) services

Beyond detent's builtin catalog, minds ships a small hardcoded list of
*additional* services in
[`libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/additional_services.json`](../../../libs/mngr_latchkey/imbue/mngr_latchkey/additional_services.json).
Their catalog entries are folded into `services.json` by that package's
generator, so the dialog and the gateway extensions treat them exactly like a
builtin service. These are third-party services minds supports itself, using
two latchkey features:

* **Registration.** At gateway bring-up, `Latchkey.initialize()` runs
  `latchkey services register <name> --base-api-url <url>` for each
  additional service (skipping any already registered, since that command
  is not idempotent), so latchkey can inject the user's stored credentials
  for the service's domain.
* **Self-shipped detent schemas, referenced via `include`.** A custom scope
  is not one of detent's builtin schemas, so each additional service ships
  its own scope schema (matching the service domain) plus a permission
  schema. Rather than inlining those schemas into every host's
  `latchkey_permissions.json`, minds materializes them **once** into a
  shared `minds_shared_schemas.json` file and has every per-host file
  reference it through detent's [`include`](https://github.com/imbue-ai/detent)
  directive. Granting an additional-service scope is then a plain rule
  write (no schema injection); detent resolves the scope's schema from the
  shared include. The include is a bare relative name, which detent resolves
  relative to the referencing file's directory -- so the same host file
  works both on the desktop (where the shared file lives in the gateway's
  opaque-handle directory) and on a VPS (where it is shipped next to the
  host's `~/.latchkey/permissions.json`).

Additional services are merged into the same catalog the dialog reads, so
they appear and are granted exactly like builtin ones. The seed entry is
`claude.ai`, which exposes a single `everything` permission (full access
to the `claude.ai` domain). Because registered services support only
static-argument credentials, authenticating one is a manual
`latchkey auth set <name> -H "..."` (the browser sign-in flow does not
apply); granting the permission and supplying credentials are independent
steps.

## Connectors and accounts (Settings page)

The app-level Settings page's **Connectors** tab lists, per connected
service, the accounts the user has signed in to (latchkey 3.0.0 stores
credentials per account). The account list is read from
`latchkey services info <service> --offline` -- the `credentials` object,
keyed by account name (the unnamed default account keyed by `""`) --
which also drives the aggregate credential status the grant flow uses.

Two per-service actions manage accounts:

* **+ Add account** runs the same browser sign-in as approving a
  permission request whose service has no credentials yet
  (`Latchkey.add_account`), but with `LATCHKEY_EPHEMERAL_BROWSER=1` set so
  the browser starts from a clean session and the user lands on a fresh
  sign-in screen -- letting them add a genuinely new account instead of
  being silently re-authenticated as an already-signed-in one. For a Minds
  Google OAuth service, if signing in with the official Minds client does
  not succeed, it always falls back to a fresh `auth browser-prepare`
  self-setup step and retries.
* **Disconnect** clears one account's stored credentials
  (`latchkey auth clear <service> --account <account>`). Disconnecting the
  *last* account for a service also runs the per-service "revoke all"
  cleanup in the background -- stripping that service's grants from every
  workspace host file, since they would otherwise have no credentials
  behind them.

Below the accounts, the panel shows the existing per-workspace grants
("Allowed on all accounts:"), which are unchanged.

## Agent-side responsibilities

Agents are expected to:

* Detect the three blocked outcomes from the gateway response.
* POST a permission request to the gateway's `permission-requests`
  extension (`POST /permission-requests` with `scope`, `permissions`,
  and `rationale`).
* Stop the turn and wait. The agent will receive an `mngr message` from
  the desktop with the decision and can decide whether to retry.

The detection-and-wait logic for Claude Code lives in the
`default-workspace-template` repository's latchkey skill, not in this
monorepo.
