"""``minds_services`` test: the analytics collection loop against a real env's databases.

Exercises the runner's real SQL against the shared env's live Postgres: the
explorer consent sync (prefix join on ``account_entitlements``), online
workspace enumeration from ``pool_hosts``, the poll's advisory lock, and the
audited refused-hop path -- the ops tables are created from the committed
analytics migrations in a per-test schema of the same database, and a
fixture explorer account + leased workspace row (pointing at an unreachable
address) drive one full ``run_collection_poll_with_connections`` pass whose
SSH hop is genuinely refused and lands in the real ``collection_runs`` audit.

The in-workspace half (script injection, redaction, protocol) is covered by
the analytics acceptance test (``test_injected_script.py``); this test owns
the server-side loop against real infrastructure. Collecting from a real
leased workspace additionally requires the tier's pool SSH key and a live
lease, which stays a manual bringup-verification step
(apps/analytics/docs/bringup.md).
