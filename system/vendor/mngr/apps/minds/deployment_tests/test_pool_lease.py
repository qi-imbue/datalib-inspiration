"""Lease / user-isolation / release against a real pre-baked pool slice.

The slice-era version of the pool test deferred by
specs/minds-deployment-tests.md, enabled by the CI pool pre-bake stage
(specs/remote-workspaces-in-ci.md): lease a pool host as user A, assert user B
cannot see (or release) it through the user-facing API, then release it as A
and assert the slice is gone. Consumes one baked slice (release destroys the
slice VM and deletes the row).
