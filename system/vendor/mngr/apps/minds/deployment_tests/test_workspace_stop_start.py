"""End-to-end workspace stop/start against a real env (box + bucket + connector).

Leases a pool host, stops it through the connector's workspace lifecycle
(VM halt + artifact upload, then the retention finalize frees the slot),
starts it again (a restore onto a same-region box, since the finalize has
already reaped the local VM), verifies the restored coordinates answer SSH,
and releases the lease.

Needs a pool with at least one available baked slice AND workspace storage
configured for the env. An empty pool FAILS by default (the CI release flow
pre-bakes slices, so an empty pool there means the bake stage broke -- see
specs/remote-workspaces-in-ci.md); set ``MINDS_ALLOW_EMPTY_POOL=1`` to skip
instead when running against an env that legitimately has no pool (e.g.
``just minds-test-services-against dev-<you> ...``, which sets it). Missing
workspace storage still skips.

The full cycle was opt-in while the CI boxes were gen-1: the ~13GB artifact
upload ran at ~1.4MB/s effective there (~2.6 hours). The gen-2 CI boxes upload
over the S3 IPv4 pin at ~100MB/s (minutes), so the test now runs in every
release dispatch; the deadlines below are budgeted to the gen-2 cycle.
