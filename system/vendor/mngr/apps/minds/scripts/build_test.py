"""Tests for the bundling contract that ``apps/minds/scripts/build.js`` relies on.

The build script calls ``uv build --package <name> --wheel`` for each workspace
package it ships. Two properties are load-bearing:

- Every bundled wheel must be pure Python (``py3-none-any``), because the
  build is single-platform and the wheel is shipped to all platforms as-is.
- Every bundled wheel must exclude test files, because the packaged app has
  no use for them and shipping them bloats the bundle / exposes test-only
  imports to the runtime.

``test_workspace_wheel_is_pure_python`` and
``test_workspace_wheel_excludes_test_files`` run ``uv build`` for each
workspace package listed in ``WORKSPACE_PACKAGES`` and assert both
properties. Because they exercise the real build toolchain and build every
wheel, they are marked ``@pytest.mark.acceptance``.

``test_workspace_package_lists_are_consistent`` is a fast, pure file-parsing
drift guard (no toolchain, no network) and stays an unmarked integration
test so it runs on every branch.
