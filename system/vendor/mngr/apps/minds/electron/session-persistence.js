// Pure helpers for persisting the desktop client's window-state.json.
//
// Kept free of any `electron` imports (like startup-routing.js and
// view-layout.js) so both pieces can be unit-tested under plain node -- see
// ../test/unit/session-persistence.test.js. main.js wires these to the real
// window set: it schedules a debounced save on window move/resize/navigation
// and applies the empty-clobber guard inside saveSessionState.

/**
 * Decide whether a freshly-computed session-state window list may be written
 * over the current on-disk window-state.json.
 *
 * Why this guard exists: the window list is captured from the LIVE window set
 * at save time. A non-graceful quit -- the ToDesktop "Install and Restart"
 * auto-update path, a crash, or a force-quit -- tears the windows down
 * concurrently with the save, so the captured list can come back EMPTY even
 * though the user had windows open. Writing that empty list clobbers a
 * perfectly good window-state.json, and the next launch computes
 * ``restorableCount === 0`` and drops the user on the create screen instead of
 * their restored workspace.
 *
 * Rule: an empty computed list may only be written when the on-disk file is
 * ALSO empty (or missing / unreadable -- ``persistedWindowCount === 0``). If
 * the computed list is empty but a non-empty set is already persisted, treat it
 * as a teardown-race artifact and skip the write, preserving the good file.
 *
 * This never rejects a legitimate save: while the app is running with windows
 * open, every save computes a non-empty list. The only in-app path to zero
 * windows is closing the last window, and that saves through the quit sequence
 * while the last window is still alive (a non-empty list). So a computed-empty
 * list while a non-empty file exists is always a race, never a real state.
 *
 * @param {object} counts
 * @param {number} counts.computedWindowCount   Windows in the just-computed snapshot.
 * @param {number} counts.persistedWindowCount  Windows in the current on-disk file.
 * @returns {boolean} true if the snapshot should be written to disk.

/**
 * True when two persisted window entries describe the SAME saved window -- same
 * content url and the same geometry (position, size, and display).
 *
 * Why this exists: at cold start the initial window is positioned from
 * ``savedState.windows[0]`` BEFORE the backend is ready, and then the restore
 * path (once the backend is up) picks the first *restorable* entry -- the saved
 * windows whose workspaces still exist, filtered from the same list. When that
 * entry is the one the window was already positioned at, re-applying its bounds
 * is redundant AND snaps the window back over any move the user made while the
 * loading screen was up. main.js uses this to skip that redundant re-apply,
 * re-applying only when the restored entry is a DIFFERENT saved window (the MRU
 * window's workspace was filtered out, so a never-positioned entry takes its
 * place). A by-value comparison keeps this correct regardless of whether the
 * restorable list preserves the original entry objects by reference.
 *
 * @param {object|undefined} a  A persisted window entry ({ url, x, y, width, height, displayId }).
 * @param {object|undefined} b  Another persisted window entry.
 * @returns {boolean} true if both are present and describe the same saved window.

/**
 * Create a trailing-throttle scheduler that coalesces a burst of ``schedule()``
 * calls into at most one ``save()`` per ``delayMs``.
 *
 * Semantics: the first ``schedule()`` after an idle period arms a timer;
 * further ``schedule()`` calls while that timer is pending are coalesced into
 * it (no new timer). When the timer fires, ``save()`` runs once and the
 * scheduler returns to idle. This bounds disk writes to at most one per
 * interval even under continuous activity (a window drag/resize fires move/
 * resize events every frame), while still flushing promptly after the burst.
 *
 * ``setTimer`` / ``clearTimer`` are injectable so tests can drive it without
 * real timers; they default to the global timer functions.
 *
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {() => void} options.save          Persist callback (runs the actual write).
 * @param {number} options.delayMs           Coalescing window in milliseconds.

 * @param {Function} [options.clearTimer]    Defaults to global clearTimeout.
