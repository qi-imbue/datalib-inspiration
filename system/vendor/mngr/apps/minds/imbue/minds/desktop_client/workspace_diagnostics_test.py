"""Unit coverage for the bug report's workspace diagnostics collection.

Exercises the host half of ``workspace_diagnostics``: the ``mngr exec`` argvs,
the staging of the collector's one base64 line into the report's private
directory, the one-line notes every failure mode resolves to, and the latchkey
gateway-tail mirror.

The exec boundary is driven through a fake ``mngr`` executable placed first on
``PATH`` -- the same stub technique ``agent_creator_test`` uses -- because
collection resolves the real binary the way every other desktop-client exec
path does. The stub prints the ``--format json`` envelopes the real mngr
prints, answering the collector exec and the ``--outer`` mirror exec
separately so a test can shape each one on its own. What the archive CONTAINS
is the collector's business, covered by the template repo's own tests; here a
tiny fixture zip stands in for it.
