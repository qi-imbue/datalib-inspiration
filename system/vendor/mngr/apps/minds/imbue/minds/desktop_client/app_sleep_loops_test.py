"""Unit coverage for the ``app.py`` loops that produce and consume the sleep signal.

The heartbeat loop, whose ticks *are* the detector and which nothing else
tests; and the system-interface health probe loop, which must establish the
wake for itself before it ages any failure run against it. The discovery
watchdog's own version of that second concern lives in
``app_discovery_watchdog_loop_test.py`` -- the two loops share the hazard
because they share the shape: both were frozen by the same sleep and both are
released from it at the same instant.
