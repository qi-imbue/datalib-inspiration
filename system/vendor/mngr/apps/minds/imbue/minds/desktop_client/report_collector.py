"""Gather a user-submitted bug report and hand it to Sentry.

Backs both the local "report a bug" form and the authenticated ``/api/v1`` bug-report route, so reports
from either path carry the same shape and are submitted the same way. All Sentry submission is owned by
the outer minds app -- agents never reach Sentry directly.

What is collected depends on the report's context: the description and a handful of always-cheap
"basics" (versions, OS) are unconditional; app diagnostics are added when requested, and per-workspace
context whenever the report was opened from a known workspace. Each collected value comes from an in-process source (build info, the session store, the
backend resolver, the standard library), so collection is fast and side-effect free.
