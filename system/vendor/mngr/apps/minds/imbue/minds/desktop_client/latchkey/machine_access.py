"""Reaching a remote workspace's own machine from the desktop app.

A remote workspace's credentials and the policy its gateway enforces live on
its own machine (its VPS). Everything the app does with either -- showing the
Permissions tab, connecting a service, signing one out, flipping a toggle --
therefore has to go *to* that machine, and this module is the door: it opens
the workspace's outer host and hands back a
:class:`~imbue.mngr_latchkey.remote.credentials.MachineCredentials` bound to it.

Opening that door needs mngr's provider set, which is loaded from the same
settings the ``mngr`` CLI reads. It is loaded **once, lazily**, and kept for the
life of the process: loading it imports every installed provider plugin, which
is seconds of work that must not land on the first click. :meth:`warm` starts
that load off the request path at startup, so in practice the first Permissions
tab open finds it done.

Every call here is synchronous and blocks its caller until the machine has
answered. That is the point: a workspace's Permissions tab shows what its
machine holds, not what this computer last heard, and a change is reported as
made only once the machine has taken it. A local workspace has no machine of its
own -- its agents run here, on the credentials and the permissions file this
computer keeps -- and :meth:`MachineAccess.machine_host_for` is what says so, so
its caller can leave the local edit as the whole change.
