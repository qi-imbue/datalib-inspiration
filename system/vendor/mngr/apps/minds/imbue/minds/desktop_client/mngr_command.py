"""Run ``mngr`` subprocesses to completion for the lower-level desktop-client modules.

Extracted so the agent-facing ``/api/v1`` handlers and their lower modules
(``workspace_settings``, ``desktop_control``) can shell out to ``mngr`` with the
same raise-on-failure policy without importing ``app.py`` (which would be an
import cycle). ``run_mngr_to_completion`` is that policy: a non-clean outcome
surfaces as the single ``MngrCommandError`` callers already catch (a timeout as
the more specific ``MngrCommandTimeoutError``), carrying mngr's verdict as its
message and a bounded tail of what the subprocess printed.
``run_mngr_capturing`` underneath it serves callers (``workspace_diagnostics``)
that inspect the returncode and output of an unclean exit themselves.
