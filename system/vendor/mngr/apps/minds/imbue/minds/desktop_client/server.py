"""Graceful cheroot WSGI server + lifecycle for the Flask desktop client.

Replaces the FastAPI/uvicorn ``_PreShutdownAwareServer`` subclass and the
async ``_managed_lifespan`` teardown with one synchronous, explicitly-ordered
shutdown path:

1. On SIGINT/SIGTERM, before the server drains, flip ``shutdown_event`` and
   poke the backend resolver's change callback so every long-lived SSE
   generator wakes and returns cleanly (no mid-stream cancellation, no
   tracebacks on a clean exit).
2. Stop the WSGI server (from a helper thread -- ``stop()`` must not be called
   from the thread running ``serve()``).
3. Once serving has stopped, run the teardown sequence: close the shared
   HTTP client, terminate the envelope + permission-requests consumers, stop
   the pre-warmed mngr caller, and drain the root concurrency group.

The server is cheroot's pure-Python threaded WSGI server rather than the
Werkzeug development server. Werkzeug's dev server hardcodes ``Connection:
close`` on every response (it cannot drain a keep-alive socket before the next
request line), so it never reuses connections. The prior uvicorn server spoke
HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive, and the Electron shell relies on that: its main
process consumes the one-time login code with a ``net.request`` to
``/authenticate`` that 307-redirects to ``/`` and *awaits* the followed
response before loading the chrome view. Chromium's network stack does not
follow that redirect cleanly when the 307 closes the socket, so the await --
and the whole UI startup -- hangs. cheroot restores real HTTP/1.1 keep-alive
(and still streams Server-Sent-Events chunk-by-chunk), matching the wire
behavior the shell was built against.

``desktop_client_runtime`` is a context manager that owns startup (HTTP client
+ geo detection) and the teardown above; ``serve_desktop_client`` runs the
server inside it.
