"""Cross-workspace read/revoke view of predefined (catalog-backed) latchkey grants.

Backs the App-level settings "Permissions" section: it enumerates the
predefined-service permissions granted on every *active* workspace's host and
lets the user revoke them. Revocation removes the rule from that host's
``latchkey_permissions.json`` (through the gateway's bundled ``permissions``
extension, the single owner of on-disk permission writes); stored credentials
are left untouched, so a fresh grant does not force the user to re-authenticate.

Grants are per *account*: a host's rule key is ``<scope>:<account>`` (see
:mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes`), so the Connectors page is organized
as one section per signed-in account rather than one per service. A section is
shown for every account latchkey has stored *and* for every account that still
appears in some host's rules without being connected (one whose credentials were
cleared outside the app, or one that was granted before it was ever connected),
so no grant is invisible and unrevocable.

Permissions are stored per host -- every agent on a host shares one
``latchkey_permissions.json`` (see :func:`permissions_path_for_host`). Minds
workspaces map 1:1 to hosts, so each column in the settings view is one
workspace, labelled by its primary agent's display name. Only non-destroyed
workspaces are shown (via
:meth:`BackendResolverInterface.list_active_workspace_ids`).

This module is deliberately read/revoke only: changing (broadening or
narrowing) an existing grant is done through the ordinary agent-driven
permission-request flow, not here.
