"""Plugin-side helpers for the desktop-client machine-sharing flow.

Sharing is machine-level in the self-hosted relay design: one share per
workspace host, one grants document covering the workspace plus optional
per-service scopes. The connector owns the share record + relay token
(`mngr imbue_cloud shares ...`); authorization lives in the workspace's own
grants file, which the in-workspace share-gateway re-reads on every request.

Enable = connector ``shares create`` -> inject the grants document + share
materials into the workspace (its share-gateway brings up caddy + frpc) ->
the UI polls readiness by probing the real hostname. Disable = clear the
materials + connector ``shares delete`` (the relay token dies, so the tunnel's
next reconnect is rejected even if the materials linger).
