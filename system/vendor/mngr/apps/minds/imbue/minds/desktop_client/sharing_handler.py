"""Plugin-side helpers for the desktop-client Cloudflare-tunnel sharing flow.

Sharing is configured exclusively from the desktop client's
``/sharing/{agent_id}/{service_name}`` editor route -- agents no longer
write sharing-request events back into the inbox. This module retains
:func:`enable_sharing_via_cloudflare`, the per-account work that the
direct editor route invokes when the user enables or updates sharing
from the workspace settings UI.

All Cloudflare state is owned by the connector behind ``mngr imbue_cloud
tunnels …``; minds keeps no local tunnel-token cache. The plugin's
``create_tunnel`` is idempotent on the connector side -- calling it for
an existing tunnel returns the same token rather than rotating, so
re-injection on every grant is safe.
