"""Latchkey permission-detail HTML rendering.

The detail fragment renderers compose the shared Permissions* JinjaX
components (PermissionsHeader, PermissionsForm,
PermissionsManualCredentials, PermissionsError) into the right-pane
body for a single pending latchkey permission request. The inbox shell
provides the surrounding modal chrome (backdrop, close button, submit
JS, escape/backdrop dismiss).

* :func:`render_predefined_permission_dialog` renders the
  ``pages.LatchkeyPredefinedPermission`` component (checkbox per detent
  permission schema, with the auth-browser progress notice);
* :func:`render_file_sharing_permission_dialog` renders the
  ``pages.LatchkeyFileSharingPermission`` component (single hidden
  ``permissions=file-sharing`` input so the fragment reads as a plain
  yes/no for the requested path).

Keeping these renderers next to the handlers (rather than in the shared
``desktop_client/templates.py``) keeps the latchkey-shaped function
signatures -- notably the one that takes ``ServicePermissionInfo`` --
out of the generic template module.
