"""Background scheduler for workspace-record sync.

Runs the reconcile (pull + legacy migration + metadata refresh + dirty pushes
+ definitively-absent tombstoning) event-driven: once after the session's
first complete discovery snapshot, then on a slow periodic tick, and
immediately whenever :meth:`WorkspaceSyncScheduler.kick` is called (sign-in /
sign-out, password changes). The legacy password-file conversion runs at the
start of every pass (a no-op once converted).

One daemon thread; every pass is wrapped so an expected failure (a connector
outage, or any sync / crypto / file error) can never kill the loop.
