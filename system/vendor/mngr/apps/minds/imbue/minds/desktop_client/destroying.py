"""Per-agent destroy lifecycle, run as a detached subprocess.

Why this file uses raw ``subprocess.Popen`` (with the matching ratchet
exclusion in ``test_ratchets.py``): we need the destroy command to
*outlive* the minds desktop client. ``mngr destroy`` against a Docker
host can take ~30-60 seconds; if minds shuts down (Electron quit,
laptop close, crash) mid-destroy, we want the destroy to keep going to
completion rather than leak a half-destroyed agent. ``ConcurrencyGroup``
guarantees the opposite -- every spawned process is killed on group
exit -- so it is structurally the wrong tool here. Same justification as
``apps/minds/imbue/minds/desktop_client/latchkey/_spawn.py``.

Status is fully derived from disk + the live resolver; there is no
state.json. For each in-flight destroy ``<paths.data_dir>/destroying/<agent_id>/``
contains ``pid`` (single-line text), ``host_id`` (the host the destroy is
tearing down), ``provider`` (the provider instance that owns the host, when
discovery knew it) and ``output.log`` (combined stdout+stderr from the
``mngr destroy`` process). :py:class:`DestroyingStatus` is computed from ``pid`` liveness +
whether the workspace's *host* is still up -- the caller answers that via
``is_host_still_active`` (see its docstring: agent still active, host not yet
positively gone). Keying on the host, not just the workspace agent, is
deliberate: a minds host also runs a ``system-services`` agent, so a destroy
that removed only the workspace agent must read as FAILED, not DONE.

  - dir present + pid alive                       -> RUNNING
  - dir present + pid dead + host gone            -> DONE   (caller deletes the dir)
  - dir present + pid dead + host still up        -> FAILED (kept for inspection)

The ~1-second window between the destroy subprocess exiting and the
``mngr observe`` discovery tail picking up the host's ``DESTROYED`` state
can briefly flip status to FAILED for a successful destroy. The detail
page poll picks up the corrected status on the next tick. Acceptable
jitter; documented in ``specs/detached-destroy-flow/spec.md``.

    Destroying only the workspace agent would leave the constant

    it: destroying the host calls ``provider.destroy_host`` which (for
