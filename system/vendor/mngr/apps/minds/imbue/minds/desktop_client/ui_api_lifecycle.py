"""/ui/api routes owned by tranche T4 (backups/destroy/recovery).

Three surfaces:

- ``GET /ui/api/destroyed-workspaces`` -- the JSON twin of the deleted
  ``/workspaces/destroyed/rows`` HTML fragment: tombstoned records still in
  the backup retention window (newest destroyed first) plus orphan backup
  envs this device holds, with the retention window for the page header.
- ``POST /ui/api/destroyed-workspaces/<agent_id>/delete-backup`` -- frees a
  destroyed workspace's backup quota now instead of waiting out retention.
- ``GET /ui/api/workspaces/<workspace_id>/recovery-info`` -- everything the
  Recovery card needs beyond the live channel health state: the resolved
  agent id (either workspace coordinate is accepted, since restored windows
  navigate host-keyed), the display name, the copy-pasteable SSH command,
  whether the host currently reads as offline, and whether the machine's
  backend is unreachable (with the provider's own reason). The card polls
  this while it is open, so every field is a current reading rather than a
  one-shot snapshot taken when it opened.

This module is the single home of the destroyed-row derivation (moved here
from ``app.py``'s deleted legacy page handlers).
