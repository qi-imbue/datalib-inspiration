"""Collect the bug report's workspace archive via the template's resident collector.

The workspace template ships a collector script inside every workspace
(``WORKSPACE_COLLECTOR_PATH``). It gathers the workspace logs and the recent
conversations the report asked for, secret-scans everything as plaintext with
the template's own scan gate, and prints exactly one line: the base64 of a zip.
Anything requested that the collector withheld is a plain-words line in the
archive's own ``collection-notes.txt`` member, so the archive explains itself
and this module has nothing to interpret -- it decodes the line and stages the
file. The exec rides ``mngr exec --format json``, whose envelope separates the
remote stdout from mngr's own output.

The workspace's latchkey gateway (remote workspaces run one on their outer
host) logs outside the container, so the resident collector cannot see it. A
second, cheap ``mngr exec --outer`` mirrors its tail into the latchkey plugin
data dir, where the existing latchkey attachment groups sweep it onto every
event -- see ``refresh_remote_gateway_log_mirror``.

The Electron shell's console tail is not this module's concern: it is the
shell's own output, staged app-side by ``report_collector`` without any
workspace involvement.

Everything here degrades rather than fails. A stopped host, an unreachable
container, or a slow exec resolves to a one-line ``note`` on the returned
result -- a plain-words sentence recorded on the report -- and a bug report is
never blocked by its own diagnostics, so ``collect_workspace_diagnostics``
raises nothing for a collection failure.

The staged archive is attached one-shot, by exact path, to the report it was
collected for (``submit_manual_bug_report``'s ``report_file_paths``). Each
report stages into its own fresh directory under the system temp dir, so
collections that overlap -- reports submit immediately and upload in the
background -- cannot see each other's files, nothing ever needs deleting up
front, and no Sentry attachment group can sweep a staged file onto an
unrelated event. Leftover staging is the operating system's ordinary temp
cleanup's to reclaim.
