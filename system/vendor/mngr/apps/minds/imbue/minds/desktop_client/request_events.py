"""Request and response event types for the minds request inbox.

Agents write request events (permissions, latchkey-permission) to
``$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR/events/requests/events.jsonl``. The desktop
client watches these and presents them in an inbox panel. Response
events (grant/deny) are written by the desktop client to
``~/.minds/events/requests/events.jsonl``.

All events use the ``EventEnvelope`` base class for consistent structure.
The inbox state is computed by aggregating all request and response events
(event sourcing).
