"""Minds-side wrapper around the ``mngr forward`` plugin subprocess.

Phase 2 deletes minds' in-process subdomain-forwarding, auth, and observe-
spawning code; this file replaces them with a thin consumer that:

- spawns ``mngr forward --observe-via-file`` as a subprocess so it tails the
  shared discovery events file written by the single ``mngr observe`` under
  ``mngr latchkey forward`` instead of running its own observe;
- reads stdout line-by-line on a background thread and parses each line as a
  ``ForwardEnvelope``;
- dispatches by ``stream``: ``observe`` lines are folded into a shared
  ``DiscoveryStateAggregator`` (the span-aware, per-provider reconciler), whose
  view is then pushed into the surviving ``MngrCliBackendResolver`` and fanned
  out to a set of ``on_agent_discovered`` / ``on_agent_destroyed`` callbacks;
  ``event`` lines drive the resolver's
  service map and fan out to request callbacks; ``forward`` lines
  feed the ``system_interface_backend_failure`` health tracker and the
  ``listening`` port handshake;
- watches the subprocess for premature exit and reports it (the consumer is
  dead, so the discovery pipeline is down) to the discovery-health watchdog
  via registered ``on_unexpected_exit`` callbacks.

Provider-set changes are picked up by bouncing the detached ``mngr latchkey
forward`` supervisor (the single discovery observer); the tailer here then sees
the fresh snapshot automatically, so this consumer no longer sends ``SIGHUP``.
