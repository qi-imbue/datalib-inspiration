"""Per-workspace toggle view and editing of latchkey permissions.

Backs the workspace options panel's "Permissions" tab: one screen, scoped to a
single workspace's host, where every grantable permission renders as a toggle.
Flipping a toggle recomputes the *complete* permission set for the affected
rule from the new toggle states and writes it back through the gateway's
``permissions`` extension (the single owner of on-disk permission writes) --
the endpoint always receives the full set, never a diff.

Three families of toggles, mirroring the permission-request types:

* **Connector toggles** -- catalog-backed third-party service permissions,
  granted per ``(scope, account)`` rule (see
  :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes`). Toggling writes the rule with
  :func:`build_account_grant`, so the generated per-account schema always
  travels with it; turning the last permission off deletes the rule.
* **File-sharing toggles** -- the ``minds-file-server-*`` permission names on
  the shared ``latchkey-self`` rule. The rule also carries baseline / accounts
  / workspace permissions, so a rewrite always preserves every name this
  module does not own.
* **Machine (cross-workspace) toggles** -- the ``minds-workspaces-*`` verb
  names on the same ``latchkey-self`` rule, preserved the same way.

``Add connection`` is the fourth write: it connects a service that has no
account yet (or a further account of one that has). Most services are connected
by latchkey's browser sign-in, which the settings page's route already runs;
the rest -- AWS, Coolify, ... -- are connected by
:func:`connect_service_with_credentials`, which fills the values the user typed
into the service's own credential command (see
:mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.credential_commands`) and runs it. Which of the two a
service takes travels with it as :class:`ServiceSignIn`, so the pane never
offers a sign-in that cannot happen.

Enabling a ``latchkey-self`` toggle needs the permission's schema definition to
already exist in the host file (per-path / per-verb schemas are minted by the
gateway when a request is approved; revoking leaves them behind precisely so
the permission can be re-enabled here). A name whose schema is gone cannot be
re-enabled -- detent fails the entire check when a referenced schema is
unknown. Rows exist for the names the file knows about at all: the granted
ones plus the ones whose schema survives a revoke. So a name with neither is
not offered, and a name that is granted with no schema left behind it carries
``can_enable=False`` -- it can still be turned off, but only the agent
re-requesting brings it back.

The desktop client is the only writer: page JS posts one toggle flip, the
route recomputes the full set server-side (so a buggy client can never clobber
unrelated ``latchkey-self`` baselines), and the gateway merges the write.
