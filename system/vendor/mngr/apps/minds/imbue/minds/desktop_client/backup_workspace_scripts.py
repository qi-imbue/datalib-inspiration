"""Self-contained python3 scripts minds runs inside a workspace via ``mngr exec``.

Four scripts, all stdlib-only (they run under the workspace's system python3
with no access to minds code), all parameterized via argv and all reporting a
single marker-prefixed JSON line on stdout so the caller can parse a verdict
out of arbitrarily noisy output:

- the *check* script: verifies the installed backup-service code against the
  *minimum required* ``minds-v*`` tag (fetching tags from the ``official``
  remote only when the tag is missing locally), reports the supervisord state
  of the ``host-backup`` program and the current ``data/.secrets/restic.env``
  (sha256 + content, so minds can compare against its canonical copy and adopt
  externally configured envs).
- the *gate probe* script: reports which chat agents are actively RUNNING
  (agents sharing the repo-root work_dir, excluding the ``main``-type
  services agent -- worktree/worker agents live elsewhere and never count)
  and whether a backup tick is currently in flight.
- the *apply update* script: the single mutating step -- stash, check out
  the backup-service code (``system/services/host_backup``,
  ``system/libs/host_backup``, or ``libs/host_backup``
  on pre-declutter workspaces) at the target tag, commit ``backup-update: <tag>``,
  ``uv sync``, restart the service, verify it comes back, and auto-rollback
  (``git revert``) on failure. Optionally stops running chats first.
- the *restore* script: rewinds the whole backup root to a chosen restic
  snapshot, in place -- gate on chats/ticks, stop every supervisord service
  (they all run from and write into the tree this restore rewrites), take
  a ``pre-restore`` safety snapshot (so any restore is undoable), then
  ``restic restore <id>:<subpath> --target <backup_root> --delete`` with
  ``--overwrite if-changed``: no staging copy, only changed files are
  rewritten, and a failed restore converges when simply re-run. The current
  ``restic.env`` is written back afterwards, a ``restored`` snapshot of the
  restored state is appended (tagged with the source snapshot's time, so the
  timeline shows the restored version as a new "Restored from ..." entry),
  then ``uv sync`` and a restart of every supervisord service. Every exit
  path after the service stop restarts the services (best-effort). The
  snapshot's subpath (the directory inside the snapshot that corresponds to
  the backup root) and timestamp are resolved by minds and passed in via argv,
  so the script never queries restic for metadata minds already holds. The
  in-place restore needs restic >= 0.17; when the workspace's restic is
  older, the script downloads the pinned, sha256-verified build and installs
  it persistently (shadowing the distro binary, so the whole workspace
  converges on the pinned version). Long restic operations stream throttled
  progress lines on stdout so the desktop can show a live accounting.

The scripts are shipped base64-encoded through the shell (the base64 alphabet
contains no shell-significant characters), decoded and piped into ``python3 -``
on the workspace; parameters travel as plain argv.
