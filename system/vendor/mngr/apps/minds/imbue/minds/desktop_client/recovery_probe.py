"""Recovery diagnostics probe.

Powers the workspace-recovery page's diagnostics list. The endpoint reads
the outer host/provider state from the passive discovery resolver (a single
sampler shared with the rest of minds -- no synchronous ``mngr list``) and
runs a batched in-container probe via ``mngr exec`` when that outer state is
healthy -- or when the discovery stream itself has stalled, making the exec's
outcome the only direct evidence available -- then returns a flat list of
named probes, each capturing
the question asked, the command (or pseudo-command label) that produced the
data, the raw output captured, and a derived yes/no/unknown answer.

The recovery-page client renders each probe row as a question with a
check / x / question-mark indicator and an expandable command + output
panel. The page's restart-tier branching keys off a single derived
``dispatch_tier`` field so the rendering stays a pure projection of the
probe data, not a parallel set of natural-language fields.

The single sentinel ``===PROBE-READY===`` is printed before the in-container
JSON payload. If the sentinel is absent from stdout, the "Can we run a
command inside the container?" probe answers ``no`` -- the ``mngr exec``
plumbing returned without ever invoking the in-container script, so we
have no in-container observations and the page steers the user to a
consent-gated host restart.

    Ordered by precedence:

    * BACKEND_UNREACHABLE beats every other tier: if the provider that produces
      the host-state observations is itself unreachable (or rejecting us), no
      restart routed through it can help and the host-state probes cannot be
      trusted, so the provider-error signal wins outright. We do not sub-classify
      by error kind (a stopped daemon, a paused daemon, an expired login all land
      here): the user-facing impact is identical -- show the provider's own
      message, offer Retry, and wait for it to recover.
    * HEALTHY / HOST_UNRESPONSIVE / INDETERMINATE next, whenever the batched exec
      reached the container (``can_run`` is YES). Direct in-container evidence is
      authoritative regardless of snapshot freshness or how we got here: the
      container is demonstrably up, so a live GET / 200 is proof the interface is
      answering (HEALTHY, sent home). A non-200 with supervisord reporting the
      service STARTING or BACKOFF means supervisord is already self-healing it --
      keep checking (INDETERMINATE). Any other non-200 is the consent-gated
      HOST_UNRESPONSIVE: the page's liveness poll still sends the user home the
      moment the interface self-heals, so no restart fires without a click.
    * INDETERMINATE when the exec probe timed out: it observed *nothing* (a
      timeout is absence of evidence, not evidence of a down workspace -- e.g. a
      probe whose window spanned a laptop sleep). The page keeps checking and a
      later probe that *completes* resolves to a real tier.
    * The trusted host-state verdicts, when a discovery snapshot taken at/after
      the outage onset backs the host state. These branch on the *raw* state
      rather than the collapsed "is it running?" probe answer, because the
      states diverge in display treatment: STOPPED / CRASHED -> HOST_OFFLINE
      (container observed fully stopped); FAILED -> HOST_UNRESPONSIVE (a
      failed-to-create host, where a plain start mostly re-fails); UNAUTHENTICATED
      -> BACKEND_UNREACHABLE (the host rejected this machine's access; a
      restart routes through the same rejected credential); RUNNING ->
      HOST_UNRESPONSIVE (observed up but the exec could not get inside). A
      trusted UNKNOWN (including a host observed up but unreadable from the
      inside) / transitional / absent state says nothing either way and falls
      through to the completed-exec evidence below. Every tier is display-only -- the
      recovery flow's start-only restart is dispatched unconditionally on page
      entry, never off a verdict -- so a stale reading costs wrong page copy,
      not a wrong action; the freshness gate exists to keep even the copy
      honest.
    * HOST_UNRESPONSIVE when the exec probe was attempted and *completed*
      without ever reaching the in-container script (a nonzero exit or a clean
      exit with no sentinel -- e.g. the container's sshd is dead, or the
      container is not running at all). Unlike a timeout, a completed failure is
      a direct fresh observation that we cannot get into the container, so it
      needs no snapshot corroboration. This is what resolves the page when
      discovery itself has stalled (no snapshot at/after the onset will ever
      land): the verdict is consent-gated, so no restart fires without a click,
      and the liveness poll still sends the user home on self-recovery.
    * INDETERMINATE otherwise: no provider error, no in-container observation,
      no timeout, no trusted host state, and no completed exec -- nothing to
      base a verdict on, so render no verdict and keep checking.
