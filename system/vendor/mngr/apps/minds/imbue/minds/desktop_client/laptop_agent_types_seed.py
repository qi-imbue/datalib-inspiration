"""Seed the workspace's agent types into the laptop-side user-scope settings.toml.

mngr's project-config discovery is cwd-based: from any cwd that isn't
inside a git worktree containing `.mngr/settings.toml`, the workspace's
`[agent_types.X]` definitions are invisible. minds.app spawns `mngr forward`,
`mngr list` and `mngr message` with cwd=$HOME, so the DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE
workspace's `[agent_types.X]` blocks (which live at
`/home/user/workspace/.mngr/settings.toml` inside the workspace container, with the
laptop only ever seeing them in an ephemeral temp clone during `mngr create`)
are not loaded for those laptop-side invocations.

The cwd-independent layer is user-scope settings.toml at
``<host_dir>/profiles/<profile_id>/settings.toml``. Seeding the minimum
mapping there lets every laptop-side mngr resolve the workspace's types
(`chat` and `worker` to ClaudeAgent, `main` to the plain CommandAgent)
without affecting the system-wide ``~/.mngr/`` install used outside minds.

The seeded parent MUST match the workspace template's own declaration: the
user-scope entry cross-scope-merges with the workspace repo's
`[agent_types.X]` block during `mngr create` (run from the temp clone), and
mngr refuses to merge entries whose parents resolve to different config
classes ("Cannot merge AgentTypeConfig with ClaudeAgentConfig"). `main` is a
plain `command` agent since the workspace's ~/.claude cutover, so it is
seeded (and, for files seeded by older builds, migrated) accordingly.
