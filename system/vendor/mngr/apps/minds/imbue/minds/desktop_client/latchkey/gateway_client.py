"""Synchronous HTTP client for the latchkey gateway's bundled extensions.

The shared latchkey gateway (spawned by ``mngr latchkey forward``)
exposes two extensions added in version 2.9.0:

* ``permission-requests`` -- pending-permission queue. Agents POST to
  ``/permission-requests`` when they hit a blocked service; the desktop
  client consumes ``GET /permission-requests?follow=true`` to learn
  about new requests and ``DELETE /permission-requests/<id>`` to remove
  them once granted or denied.
* ``permissions`` -- per-host permissions config editor. The desktop
  client POSTs to ``/permissions/rules?path=<host_file>&rule_key=<scope>``
  with ``{"permissions": [...], "schemas": {...}}`` to apply a grant; the
  extension merges exactly what it is given (see
  :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes`, which composes the per-account
  schemas).

Both extensions sit behind the gateway's standard auth wall: callers
present the listen password in ``Authorization: Bearer <password>`` and
a permissions-override JWT in
``X-Latchkey-Gateway-Permissions-Override``. This client always sends
the admin JWT (minted via :meth:`Latchkey.create_admin_permissions_jwt`)
because the desktop client needs wildcard access to both extensions.

All operations are synchronous. The streaming consumer in
:mod:`permission_requests_consumer` drives the long-running
``?follow=true`` connection from a daemon thread; everything else is
called from the FastAPI request thread under
``asyncio.get_running_loop().run_in_executor``.
