"""Workspace AI-key minting: account resolution + LiteLLM key creation.

The workspace's in-UI Claude sign-in modal links to the desktop client's
mint page (GET /settings/ai-keys, handlers in ``app.py``) when the user
picks "Sign in with Imbue". The page is keyed by the workspace's mngr
**host id** (``?workspace=<host_id>``): the workspace knows its own host
id, and workspace records are keyed by it, so the owning account is
resolved from the workspace-record store (association IS record
existence). With no associated account the page errors and points the
user at the workspace's settings page to associate one.

Mint-only by design: one action mints a LiteLLM virtual key against the
owning account -- with the workspace host id baked into the key's alias
and metadata, so keys are attributable without any editable input -- and
produces an env-var-style credential blob (``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` +
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``) for pasting back into the workspace modal. Key
listing/revocation stays a CLI concern
(``mngr imbue_cloud keys litellm list/delete``).
