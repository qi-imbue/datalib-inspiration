"""Read the Electron shell's captured console output for a bug report.

The Electron main process records every renderer console message -- the minds SPA's own output and the
workspace iframe's -- into a rolling log file in the minds log dir (``electron/console-capture.js``).
That file rotates at 10MB keeping 10 gzipped rotations, the same bound ``electron.log`` and the Python
backend logs carry, and its name is one no Sentry attachment group globs.

Only the newest slice of it is read. The file is app-lifetime history bounded by that 10MB, but a
report wants the console *around the bug*, not everything the app has printed since it started. The
rotations are deliberately not read at all.

The reader hands the text to ``collect_workspace_diagnostics``, which stages it app-side as the
report's console attachment. The console never travels to the workspace and is deliberately not
secret-scanned -- the same standing as ``electron.log`` and ``minds.log``, which already upload
unscanned on every event. Reading the file (rather than a request to the shell) is the only channel
available: the desktop client is a subprocess the shell spawns, and every channel between the two
runs the other way.
