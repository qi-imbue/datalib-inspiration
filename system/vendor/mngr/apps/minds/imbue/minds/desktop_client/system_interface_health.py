"""Tracks per-agent system-interface health for the machine-recovery UX.

The plugin (``mngr_forward``) emits a ``system_interface_backend_failure``
envelope each time it observes a backend failure (connection failure, mid-SSE
EOF, or any non-2xx response), and one more -- ``STALLED`` -- for a request the
backend has not answered yet, which may still succeed. The plugin does not
decide which of those matter -- that policy lives here:
``should_enroll_suspect_for_backend_failure`` selects the ones that suggest the
backend is unreachable, and minds routes only those into ``record_failure``.

A failure envelope is only a *hint*. A single transient blip -- most commonly a
mid-SSE EOF when an SSE stream is recycled -- is not evidence that the workspace
is stuck, so ``record_failure`` never changes health on its own. It merely
enrolls the agent as a *suspect*: an agent the background probe loop should
start actively polling.

The background probe loop is the single authority on whether a workspace is
reachable. Each iteration it probes every suspect / non-HEALTHY agent and
reports the result back through ``record_probe_success`` / ``record_probe_failure``.
The state machine:

- HEALTHY -> STUCK: the probe loop observes an unbroken run of probe failures
  lasting at least ``stuck_threshold_seconds``. Every second of that run is
  backed by a real HTTP probe against the live workspace, so STUCK is never
  shown for an ephemeral signal. The SPA shows a notice band over the
  still-rendered machine, and unattended recovery *starts* the machine without
  waiting to be asked (an idempotent ``mngr start``, never a bounce).
- STUCK -> RECOVERING: the recovery dispatch marks the tracker so the recovery
  card can render a different label. The background loop stands off a
  RECOVERING agent (see ``snapshot_probe_targets``); the recovery worker's own
  readiness probe is what decides whether the machine came back, unless a sleep
  lands mid-recovery on a START (see ``invalidate_recovery_progress_after_wake``).
- RECOVERING -> RECOVERY_FAILED: a recovery failed to bring the workspace back
  within its window, or its ``mngr`` commands errored. The recovery card
  renders the failure reason and the restart affordance.
- RECOVERING -> STUCK: a recovery ended with no verdict to give on the machine
  (the connector refused the start because an operator holds the machine's
  stop). The agent goes back to the probe loop, which is what will notice the
  operator's start bringing it back.
- {STUCK, RECOVERING, RECOVERY_FAILED} -> HEALTHY: a successful probe.

Which of the two recoveries ran is :class:`HostRecoveryKind`, and the surfaces
turn on it: only the user's own click stops the machine, so only that one may be
narrated as a restart.

State changes fire registered on-change callbacks. Callbacks are invoked
outside the internal lock so they may take the FastAPI app's own locks
without deadlocking.

The probe-confirmed HEALTHY -> STUCK edge additionally fires the *stuck-edge*
callbacks, a separate channel for consumers that dispatch work. Only this edge
means "an outage just started, nothing has been tried yet": it is the sole path
into STUCK that a probe run established, and it carries the failure-run onset
the recovery verdict reads. ``mark_stuck`` forces the same state with neither.

There is no timer: the only path to STUCK is sustained, probe-confirmed
failure. An agent that emits one bad request and then idles is still handled,
because the probe loop actively polls every suspect agent regardless of
whether further traffic arrives.

That run must also be *observed* failure, not merely elapsed failure. A laptop
that sleeps mid-run stops the probe loop along with everything else, so the
seconds it slept were backed by no probe at all; a run that straddles a sleep
is restarted from the first failure observed after it (see ``sleep_tracker``),
and the threshold is reached only once it has accumulated entirely while the
process was running. A run that opens behind a wake is timing this device's own
tunnel rebuild, and is held to ``post_wake_grace_seconds`` instead. How late it
may open and still be read that way is ``post_wake_shadow_seconds``, a separate
and much larger span: a run opens when the first traffic after the wake reaches
the forward and fails, which is a question about when the app next asks for
something, not about how long the rebuild takes.

    The plugin emits a failure envelope for every non-2xx response, for
    connection-level failures (which carry no status code), and -- as
    ``STALLED`` -- for a request still in flight that the backend has not
    answered within the plugin's stall window. Minds acts only on the ones that
    suggest the backend is unreachable: anything without a status code
    (``CONNECT_ERROR`` / ``TUNNEL_SETUP_FAILED`` / ``POOL_EXHAUSTED`` /
    ``BACKEND_NOT_LISTENING`` / ``SSE_EOF`` / ``STALLED``) or an infrastructure
    5xx (502/503/504). Application errors (app 500s, ordinary 4xx) mean the
    backend is alive and responding, so they are left alone; the background probe
    still catches a genuinely-wrong or wedged backend.

    The three causes split out of ``CONNECT_ERROR`` enroll exactly as it does,
    deliberately. What they change is what the surfaces *claim* while the probe
    runs, not whether the probe runs: even a failure that is provably this
    device's fault leaves the workspace's own reachability unestablished, and a
    probe is what establishes it. Declining to enroll on them would trade a
    wrong label for a blind spot.

    ``STALLED`` is deliberately treated the same as a hard failure even though
    the request may still succeed: a wedged backend is indistinguishable from a
    slow one at that moment, and guessing wrong is cheap in only one direction.
    Enrolling a merely-slow backend costs one probe, which answers 200 and
    clears the flag; declining to enroll a wedged one leaves it undetected,
    because a HEALTHY non-suspect agent is never probed.

    ``UNRESOLVED`` is ignored outright: it means the forward has no route for the
    agent at all. A recovery routes *through* the forward, so it cannot help a
    routeless agent regardless. In practice ``UNRESOLVED`` is either a cold-start
    / fresh-forward warm-up (the forward has not caught up to discovery yet --
    this self-resolves the moment it does, so enrolling would only mark a healthy
    workspace STUCK and needlessly start it) or a genuinely-gone agent (which a
    start cannot revive). A workspace that is present but unreachable does NOT
    land here: discovery retains its (stale) route, so the dial failure surfaces

        A stopped host's system interface is unreachable, which is
        indistinguishable from a wedge by probing alone: the agent goes STUCK
        either way. Without this marker the unattended dispatch would read a
        stop the user just asked for as a failure and start the host again,
        silently undoing it -- and on a metered provider, billing them for it.

        Remembered intent rather than observed state: a host that crashed or
        shut down on its own reads STOPPED too, and that is exactly the case
        unattended recovery exists for.

        Set by the in-app stop -- before its ``mngr stop`` runs, and again once
        that stop has succeeded -- by the quit prompt's bulk stop
        (:func:`stop_workspace_hosts`), which needs it because a partial quit
        offers Cancel quit and hands back an app whose machines are down, and by
        the destroy route, whose machine is on its way to not existing at all.
        The connector sets it too, through the unattended dispatch: a live read
        that finds a cloud machine stopping, stopped or starting (someone asked
        for that stop), and a start the connector refused as an operator hold.
        Cleared by the in-app start, or by any probe that finds the machine
        answering again. That probe clear is what makes the mark self-limiting:
        a stopped machine can also be started by a route that never touches the
        start endpoint (the machines-list click-through dispatches a start), and
        those machines would otherwise stay suppressed for the life of the
        process.

        ``is_stop_in_flight`` covers the one window in which that probe clear
        would be wrong: a stop's own command, which blocks for tens of seconds
        (a cloud host, minutes) while the interface goes on answering for the
        first of them. A machine being stopped is often a probe target already
        (suspect-enrolled, STUCK, or RECOVERY_FAILED), so that 200 gets taken,
        and dropping the mark on it would hand the machine to the dispatch
        mid-stop. While a stop is in flight a probe success leaves the mark
        alone; the stop closes the window when its command returns, either by
        marking again with the default (keeping the mark, dropping the flag) or
        by calling :meth:`allow_unattended_recovery` if it failed. A destroy
        marks in flight and never reconciles: it is answered while the teardown
        is still running, and a machine that is gone has no 200 left to give.

        Scoped to this process, and to teardowns that went through those paths.
        A machine stopped from the CLI, or left stopped across an app restart,
        carries no mark, so merely reaching it is enough to auto-start it --
        session restore does exactly that, and that is the point: a user who

        second for as long as the page keeps polling. So this holds one
        observation per *cause*: a repeat of the cause already held only
        refreshes when it was last seen, and a different cause replaces it,
        which is the only case worth a log line.

        With one exception: ``CONNECT_ERROR`` is the residual class -- it means
        the cause was not established -- so it does not displace a cause that
        still is. Without that rule the surfaces flap, because an episode
        produces envelopes from several request paths at once: a pooled HTTP
        request can report ``POOL_EXHAUSTED`` while a websocket handshake
        against the same machine reports ``CONNECT_ERROR``, and at ~1 Hz the
        device-side card would appear and disappear once a second.

        "Still is" is the whole of that exception, and why the held cause carries
        when it was last reported. The forward keeps reporting a cause that is
        still happening, so one that has gone quiet for
        ``established_cause_deference_seconds`` has stopped happening -- and
        both device-side causes are things that stop: a pool refills, a socket
        that would not bind binds on the next try. Deferring to such a cause
        indefinitely would pin a momentary fault on this device over an outage
        that has since become the machine's, telling the user their machine is
        probably fine and withholding the start that would fix it. That is the
        misdiagnosis this whole decomposition exists to end, only inverted, so
        the residual reason takes over once the specific one falls silent.

        That log line is also the Sentry breadcrumb: a bug report from a user
        whose device could not reach a healthy workspace has to carry which of
        the three causes it was, or the split is unmeasurable in the field. Which
        is why it is rationed separately from the record, against a mark that a
        probe success does not drop: the record holds one observation per cause
        per *episode*, and a failure that is not the system interface's own
        outlives any number of episodes -- the machine answers every probe while
        some other service on it refuses every request. A repeat of the cause
        last logged waits out ``connection_failure_log_interval_seconds``; a
        different cause is logged at once, because that is the transition worth
        seeing.

        Does not change health, exactly as :meth:`record_failure` does not -- the
        probe loop remains the only authority on whether the workspace is
        reachable. The record is dropped with the rest of the episode's state
