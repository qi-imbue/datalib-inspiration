"""Tracks per-agent system-interface health for restart-recovery UX.

The plugin (``mngr_forward``) emits a ``system_interface_backend_failure``
envelope each time it observes a backend failure (connection failure, mid-SSE
EOF, or any non-2xx response). The plugin does not decide which of those
matter -- that policy lives here: ``should_enroll_suspect_for_backend_failure``
selects the ones that suggest the backend is unreachable, and minds routes only
those into ``record_failure``.

A failure envelope is only a *hint*. A single transient blip -- most commonly a
mid-SSE EOF when an SSE stream is recycled -- is not evidence that the workspace
is stuck, so ``record_failure`` never changes health on its own. It merely
enrolls the agent as a *suspect*: an agent the background probe loop should
start actively polling.

The background probe loop is the single authority on whether a workspace is
reachable. Each iteration it probes every suspect / non-HEALTHY agent and
reports the result back through ``record_probe_success`` / ``record_probe_failure``.
The state machine:

- HEALTHY -> STUCK: the probe loop observes an unbroken run of probe failures
  lasting at least ``stuck_threshold_seconds``. Every second of that run is
  backed by a real HTTP probe against the live workspace, so STUCK is never
  shown for an ephemeral signal. The chrome titlebar reacts by navigating the
  content view to the recovery page.
- STUCK -> RESTARTING: the restart endpoint marks the tracker so the recovery
  page can render a different label and the probe loop keeps polling.
- RESTARTING -> RESTART_FAILED: a restart tier failed to recover the workspace
  within its window, or its ``mngr`` commands errored. The recovery page
  renders the failure reason and an escalate / try-again affordance.
- {STUCK, RESTARTING, RESTART_FAILED} -> HEALTHY: a successful probe.

State changes fire registered on-change callbacks. Callbacks are invoked
outside the internal lock so they may take the FastAPI app's own locks
without deadlocking.

There is no timer: the only path to STUCK is sustained, probe-confirmed
failure. An agent that emits one bad request and then idles is still handled,
because the probe loop actively polls every suspect agent regardless of
whether further traffic arrives.
