    The device id stamps locally-hosted workspace records (``hosting_device_id``)
    so the sync reconcile can recognize this install's own rows. Its value is
    host-id-shaped for historical reasons (see ``DeviceId``). First creation adopts the
    legacy mngr ``host_id`` value when that file exists (copying it -- the
    original is left in place for mngr's local provider) so previously-synced
    records stay attributed to this install; otherwise a fresh id is minted.
    Creation is atomic (a fully-written temp file is hard-linked into place, an
    exclusive publish), so two processes racing on first launch converge on a
    single id and a visible file always holds complete contents.

    Raises ``DeviceIdError`` when either file is unreadable or holds an invalid
    value, or when the id file cannot be created -- minds must never run
    without a valid identity.
