"""Spawn an in-workspace ``/assist`` chat to help diagnose a problem.

When the user picks "have an agent help" in a loaded workspace, the desktop app
runs ``mngr create`` *inside* that workspace's container (via ``mngr exec``) to
spawn a new chat agent seeded with ``/assist <description>``. Running the create
inside the container is what lets it resolve the DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE's ``chat`` create-template
and land in the right work dir -- exactly the way the workspace's own UI creates
chats -- while keeping the coupling at the mngr CLI level (no call into the
system-interface HTTP API). The new chat is tagged with the ``assist`` label so
the system interface auto-opens its tab.

``mngr exec`` runs its COMMAND argument through a shell on the host, so the inner
``mngr create`` is assembled as a single shell string with every token quoted
(``shlex.join``); the agent-supplied description therefore cannot break out of
the ``--message`` argument.
