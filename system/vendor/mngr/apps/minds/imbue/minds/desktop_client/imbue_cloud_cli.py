"""Typed wrapper around the ``mngr imbue_cloud …`` CLI surface.

Every operation that minds previously did via direct HTTP calls into the
``remote_service_connector`` (auth, host pool, LiteLLM keys, workspace
shares) now runs as an invocation of ``mngr imbue_cloud …`` handed to a
:class:`~imbue.minds.utils.mngr_caller.MngrCaller`, which runs it in a
pre-warmed, single-use ``mngr`` process. This avoids re-paying the
multi-second interpreter + plugin-import startup on every call.

The plugin always emits a JSON document on stdout for the success case and a
JSON ``{"error": ...}`` document on stderr for the failure case (see
``libs/mngr_imbue_cloud/imbue/mngr_imbue_cloud/cli/_common.py``); this module
parses those into typed pydantic objects.
