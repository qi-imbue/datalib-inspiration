"""Typed wire models for the SPA's `/ui/ws` channel, bootstrap payload, and `/ui/api` responses.

Every frame on the channel is one of the message models below, discriminated by
its literal ``type`` field. The same models feed three consumers:

1. The WebSocket channel (`ui_channel.py`) serializes them per frame.
2. The bootstrap JSON inlined into the SPA index page (`ui_api.py`) embeds the
   connect-time snapshot so first paint needs zero extra round trips.
3. ``scripts/generate_ui_schema.py`` emits their JSON Schema, from which the
   frontend generates its TypeScript types -- these models ARE the wire
   contract, so any breaking change must bump ``UI_SCHEMA_VERSION``.

``app.py``'s row-derivation helpers still emit string-typed dict rows (a
holdover from the deleted ``/_chrome/events`` SSE wire format, which encoded
flags as ``"true"`` strings); its ``_ui_*_from_legacy_dict`` converters
translate those rows into these models, where booleans are real booleans.

The trailing section holds ``/ui/api`` request/response payloads rather than
channel frames. They live here because the generated TypeScript comes from
``UiWireSchema``, and because this module depends on nothing but pydantic --
the payload builders import it, never the other way round.
