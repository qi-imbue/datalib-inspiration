Thin wrappers around the JinjaX page components under ``templates/auth/``.
All interactivity lives in ``static/auth.js`` and the per-page inline
script blocks that remain (check-email polling, forgot-password POST,

Shares the ``Catalog`` from :mod:`templates` so both modules see the same
component cache and autoescape configuration.
