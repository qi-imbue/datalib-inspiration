"""Telling every window to rebuild a recovered machine's view, at a moment the reload can survive.

While a machine is down each window goes on painting whatever it last served,
and recovering does not change the address that view was loaded from, so the
dead page sits there until the user navigates away and back. The remedy is a
``workspace_refresh`` frame on the recovery edge, which every window applies to
its own frame.

The edge arrives at the worst possible instant when the outage was the device's
network rather than the machine. The first probe that can succeed is the first
moment the interface is back, and that is exactly when the browser invalidates
every in-flight socket: the reload commits its document and then loses the
scripts that would have booted the page, leaving a blank frame that reads as
healthy from every angle the app can see.

So a refresh raised while this device is (or has just been) unable to reach
anything is held until the network has been back for a settle interval, and
published then. Nothing is lost by being late -- the machine is already back,
and the frame is already stale -- while being early is what produces the blank
page. A refresh raised on a device with no network trouble is published
immediately, as it always was.

Only a machine the network can actually explain is ever held. A workspace on an
on-device backend answers over loopback with the wifi off, so its recovery had
nothing to do with the interface and its reload has nothing to lose to one --
and holding it would be unbounded in a way the remote case is not: the release
is the network coming back, which for a remote machine is the same event it
needed anyway, and for an on-device one may never come at all.

A laptop that sleeps inside the settle is the same transition again: a timed
wait can return the instant the machine is back, which is when the interface is
coming up. So a wake opens a settle window of its own, which both holds a
refresh raised in the seconds after the lid opens and supersedes the window a
sleeping worker was waiting out; that worker establishes the wake for itself
when its wait returns, and stands down for the window the wake opened.

This narrows the window rather than closing it: the settle is a guess about how
long an interface takes to stop flapping, and a reload issued after it can still
lose a race. What makes a lost reload recoverable is the embedder noticing that
the frame it armed never came up, which is the frontend's job and not this
module's.
