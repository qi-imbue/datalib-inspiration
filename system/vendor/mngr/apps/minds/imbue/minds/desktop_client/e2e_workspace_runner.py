"""Reusable end-to-end driver for "Electron app creates a Docker workspace".

The flow encoded here is the same one the apps/minds Electron e2e test
asserts on: launch the Electron app, drive its create form via Playwright
over CDP, and wait until the workspace's ``system_interface`` dockview UI
renders through the desktop client's subdomain proxy.

Two callers consume this module:

- ``apps/minds/test_snapshot_resume.py`` -- the pytest test
  (``test_create_workspace_and_sign_in_via_modal_then_chat_via_electron``)
  wraps :func:`create_workspace_via_electron` and always cleans up the
  resulting mngr agent in its ``finally``.
- ``scripts/snapshot_minds_e2e_state.py`` -- the Modal-snapshot script
  calls the same function but deliberately *does not* destroy the agent,
  because the whole point of the snapshot is to capture a sandbox in
  which the workspace's Docker container is alive and ready to use.

Everything in this module is non-pytest -- callers pass plain arguments
and own the environment / cleanup story themselves.
