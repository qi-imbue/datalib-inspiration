"""Abstract handler for a single permission-request kind.

The desktop client supports multiple kinds of pending requests (sharing,
latchkey-permission, ...). Each is rendered, granted, and denied through a
type-specific ``RequestEventHandler`` so the route layer can stay a thin
dispatcher: it authenticates, looks up the pending request by id, picks the
handler that claims the request's wire ``request_type``, and forwards the
rest of the work.

Adding a new request kind is now a matter of writing a new
``RequestEventHandler`` subclass and registering it with the desktop
client; no churn in ``app.py`` is required.
