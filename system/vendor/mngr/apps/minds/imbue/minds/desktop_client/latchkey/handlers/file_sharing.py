"""File-sharing permission grant/deny flow (wire ``request_type == "file-sharing"``).

This module is one of the two sibling handlers under
:mod:`imbue.minds.desktop_client.latchkey.handlers`. It owns the
flow for *file-sharing* permission requests: rendering the yes/no
dialog for a single absolute file path, calling the gateway's
``permission-requests`` extension to approve or drop the request,
appending the response event, and notifying the waiting agent via
``mngr message``.

A file-sharing permission request asks the user to grant the agent
access to a single absolute file path on the desktop host, served
through the ``minds-api-proxy`` Latchkey extension. Unlike its
:mod:`.predefined` sibling, there is no per-permission checkbox list:
the request already names the single (path, access) pair. The dialog
does, however, let the user *edit the shared path* before approving
(the agent-requested path is pre-filled into an editable field, and a
native file picker in the desktop app can fill it in). The access mode
is fixed at request-creation time and is not user-editable.

Approval calls ``POST /permission-requests/approve/<id>`` on the
gateway's ``permission-requests`` extension; the extension owns the
actual write to the agent's ``latchkey_permissions.json``. When the
user left the path unchanged the extension uses the ``effect`` payload
it precomputed at request-creation time; when the user edited the path
we send it as a ``{"path": ...}`` body and the extension recomputes the
file-sharing effect for that path (re-validating it for traversal).
Denial reuses the legacy ``DELETE /permission-requests/<id>`` path so
the gateway forgets the pending entry.
