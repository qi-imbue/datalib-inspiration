"""The one idempotent "Update backup service" operation for a workspace.

Converges everything the verification check can find: the backup-service code
(checked out at the target ``minds-v*`` tag and committed as
``backup-update: <tag>``), the injected ``restic.env`` (re-injected from the
canonical copy, rotating a drifted workspace copy aside), and the supervisord
service (restarted and verified RUNNING by the apply script).

Runs as a tracked workspace operation (the ``workspace_operations`` registry,
like restart) so the settings view can poll step-level progress:

1. Gate + wait: poll the workspace's gate probe until no backup tick is in
   flight. Actively-RUNNING chat agents block the *code* path -- the caller
   passes ``is_stop_chats`` (the "Stop all chats and retry" flow) to have the
   apply script stop them first. Waiting is unbounded and cancellable (the
   cancel just stops polling; nothing has been mutated yet).
2. Apply: one exec runs the mutating script (stash / checkout tag / commit /
   ``uv sync`` / restart / verify), which auto-rolls-back via ``git revert``
   on failure. A stash-pop conflict is reported as a warning, never a failure.
3. Env: re-inject the canonical ``restic.env`` when one exists.
4. Verify: re-run the check; remaining code/env/service problems fail the
   operation, while NOT_CONFIGURED (fixed by the configure flow, not by
   update) merely logs.

A block on running chats is reported through the operation error string with
the ``BLOCKED_BY_RUNNING_CHATS:`` prefix so the UI can offer the
"Stop all chats and retry" action.
