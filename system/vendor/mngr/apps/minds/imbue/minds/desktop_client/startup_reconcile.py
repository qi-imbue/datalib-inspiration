"""One-shot startup reconcile for orphaned Lima / Docker workspace hosts.

A workspace create that dies with the app (quit SIGTERMs the ``mngr create``
subprocess; a crash orphans it) leaves one of two things behind: a half-built
host that burns CPU forever (Lima workspaces run with idle shutdown disabled),
or a finished workspace whose account association was never recorded. This
module runs once per app startup, after discovery is available, and repairs
both -- driven by the ``workspace-id`` host label the create stamps on every
Lima / Docker host and the local pending-create-attempt records behind it.

Policy (see the lima-workspace-reliability decision log):

- A labeled host WITH a completed workspace (its ``system-services`` agent
  exists) and a pending record -> re-associate with the record's account (or
  leave private when the record carries none) and let the record hand off to
  discovery. With no record left, the workspace is simply adopted as a
  private workspace (discovery already lists it).
- A labeled half-built host (no ``system-services`` agent) is destroyed once
  its pending record is older than a 60-minute grace window (or gone
  entirely). The grace exists because after a CRASH the orphaned ``mngr
  create`` subprocess can still be mid-provisioning at the next startup. The
  record itself is kept: it backs the interrupted row's retry / dismiss.
- Hosts WITHOUT the label are never touched -- an agent-less one only gets a
  warning naming the manual cleanup command.
- Finally ``mngr gc`` (scoped to the lima + docker providers) sweeps stale
  FAILED / DESTROYED host records older than the provider's configured
  ``destroyed_host_persisted_seconds`` (mngr's 7-day default) -- minds envs
  never run gc otherwise, so the records would accumulate forever.

Everything mngr-facing goes through the CLI (``mngr list --hosts``,
``mngr destroy``, ``mngr gc``); all outcomes are log-only.
