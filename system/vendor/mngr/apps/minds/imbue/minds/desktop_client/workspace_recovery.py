"""Workspace recovery: the passive backend verdict + the recovery worker.

minds recovers a machine two ways, and they are not the same action. On the
STUCK edge it *starts* the machine, unasked: ``mngr start`` alone, which checks
ground truth at commit time and no-ops against a host that is already running,
so it can never bounce a live container. Only the user's "Restart machine" click
*restarts* one -- ``mngr stop --stop-host`` and then that same start -- because
only a bounce fixes a container that is running but wedged. Which of the two an
episode is running is :class:`HostRecoveryKind`; "restart" is reserved for the
one that stops.

These are the engine behind that flow (the recovery card's state and its two
actions). They are extracted here -- away from :mod:`app` -- so the
versioned ``/api/v1`` surface (:mod:`api_v1`) can drive them without importing
:mod:`app` (which would form an import cycle, since ``app`` imports ``api_v1``).

``read_backend_unreachable_verdict`` answers "can minds reach the provider that
hosts this machine at all?" from evidence already in hand, so a polling surface
pays nothing for it. ``run_host_recovery_sequence`` is the background worker body
(the stop step when there is one, then the start, then await recovery) that
drives both the :class:`SystemInterfaceHealthTracker` (so the recovery surfaces
re-label) and a :class:`WorkspaceOperationRegistryInterface` (so the v1
``/workspaces/operations/restart/<id>`` resource can report its status + logs).

The environment signals meet discovery here too. :mod:`environment_signals`
supplies the raw facts -- has this process been running, can this device reach
anything -- and is deliberately a leaf that knows nothing of machines or
providers, so everything that answers one of its questions *from discovery*
lives on this side of the line: :class:`WorkspaceSshEndpointSource` (the
endpoints minds itself dials, which is what the SSH facet measures),
:class:`ProviderErrorConnectivityTrigger` (a provider discovery cannot reach is
the earliest evidence a cold start on a dead network produces),
:func:`is_network_dependent_workspace` / :func:`is_network_dependent_provider`
(the on-device rule that exempts a machine dialled on this device from all of
it, read from the coordinate discovery reports and only otherwise from the
provider's backend name), and
:func:`read_environment_block` (what the recovery surfaces render). They sit
with the recovery paths that consult them: the gate on
:class:`UnattendedRecoveryDispatcher` is the one place a signal withholds an
action rather than merely explaining one.

class WorkspaceSshEndpointSource(MutableModel):
    """Supplies the connectivity detector with the SSH endpoints minds actually dials.

    The detector needs to know whether *this device* can open the connections
    minds depends on, and those are not on port 22: each machine's host is
    reached on whatever port its provider forwarded, which for imbue_cloud is a
    box-forwarded port in the 22000-32000 range. Discovery already reports the
    real coordinate per agent -- it is the same one the recovery card renders as
    a copy-pasteable ``ssh`` command -- so this hands it over rather than
    guessing.

    Read fresh on every call: a probe taken minutes later must ask about the
    machines that exist then. Deduped, because the agents on one host share its
    endpoint and probing it three times measures nothing extra.

    Machines dialled on this device are left out. Discovery reports SSH info for
    them like any other host -- a docker container is reached at ``127.0.0.1``
    on the port its daemon mapped, not through some local channel -- and an
    endpoint that answers with the wifi off cannot say anything about the
    network. Handing one over would settle the SSH facet as reachable on every
    probe, which is the facet reading the whole incompatible-network verdict
    rests on. The filter is the endpoint's own address rather than its
    provider's backend name, so the one workspace that could still slip through
    -- one whose backend cannot be identified, which every other caller treats
    conservatively as needing the network -- is judged on where it is actually
    dialled.

    Endpoints on hosts discovery reports as RUNNING come first, because the
    detector samples only the first few and one endpoint answering settles the
    facet. A host that is stopped, crashed, or in a state discovery has not
    reported cannot answer whatever the network is doing, so sampling it spends
    part of a bounded sample on a question it cannot resolve -- and every
    sampled endpoint failing is what sends the facet to the public quorum, where
    a network that blocks port 22 in particular then reads as blocking SSH
    outright and withholds a start the machine may genuinely need. Ordering
    rather than filtering: on a dead network discovery goes stale too, so a
    reading taken when nothing is known to be running must still be able to ask
    about something.

    """Stuck-edge callback that starts a machine back up when it wedges.

    A machine that stops answering gets one idempotent ``mngr start`` without
    the user asking, and the band reports it. Running in the backend rather than
    a renderer means it also covers a machine no window is displaying.

    Wired to ``add_on_stuck_edge_callback`` rather than the general on-change
    firehose: it must run once per outage episode, and the edge is the
    once-per-episode event -- the state is re-reported on every failing lap.

    ``HostRecoveryKind.START`` throughout: a pure ``mngr start`` checks ground
    truth at commit time and no-ops against a host that is already running, so
    an unattended dispatch can never bounce a live container out from under
    someone. Bouncing a running-but-wedged machine stays a decision the user
    makes, on the recovery card -- which is the only path that ever dispatches
    ``HostRecoveryKind.RESTART``.

    A machine on the far side of a network this device cannot use is the one
    case where the dispatch is withheld rather than run. Every remote machine
    goes STUCK together when the wifi drops, and every ``mngr start`` aimed at
    them fails at DNS -- turning one local condition into a burst of
    RECOVERY_FAILED cards, each with an error report of its own. So a
    network-dependent workspace's dispatch first asks the device whether it can
    reach anything, and on a confirmed no it remembers the machine as owed (the
    card and band read the same condition off the detector's published state).
    The owed dispatches run when connectivity comes back, for whichever
    machines are still stuck by then.

    The gate deliberately runs off the stuck-edge thread. That edge is fired
    from the health probe loop, which every other workspace's probing is queued
    behind, and the connectivity probe costs seconds; the wait happens on a
    one-shot worker instead. Nothing is lost by the delay -- the machine is
    already stuck, and ``mngr start`` is idempotent.

    Drives the health tracker to HEALTHY on recovery or RECOVERY_FAILED (with a
    reason) when a step errors or the system interface does not return within
    ``startup_wait_seconds`` (sized for a container cold boot). In lockstep it appends
    progress lines to, and completes / fails, the v1 ``registry`` operation so the
    ``/workspaces/operations/restart/<id>`` resource can report the same episode. A crash
    of this worker is turned into RECOVERY_FAILED by ``RecoveryWorkerFailureHandler``,
    wired as the thread's ``on_failure`` callback.

    Every RECOVERY_FAILED transition also logs at error level: the recovery
    surface is quiet (Principle 3), so a failed recovery must reach error
    reporting even though the card renders it for the user. The exception is the
    two endings that route over the network -- a step that errored, and a
    readiness wait that timed out -- while this device is confirmed offline or on
    a network that blocks SSH: those log at warning instead, since the state is
    still RECOVERY_FAILED but the failure was doomed by something no error report
    can act on (see :func:`_report_recovery_step_failure`). The endings that
    describe discovery losing a coordinate keep their error level, network or
    no: nothing about the device explains them. That is also why the
    readiness wait is given a full cold-boot budget: below it, a recovery that was
    merely slow reports itself as a failure, to the user and to error reporting

    that -- it checks ground truth at commit time, no-ops on a running host, and
    cold-boots a stopped one. Only ``HostRecoveryKind.RESTART``, from the
    "Restart machine" click on the recovery card, runs the stop step, since it
    may target a running-but-wedged container that only a bounce fixes.

    It is a property of one snapshot -- ``get_provider_errors()`` holds whatever

    from a poll that predates the outage onset describes a previous episode, not

    (:func:`_in_band_provider_outage_reason`) is not gated, because a command
    mngr rejected at the provider is a live observation with no snapshot behind
    it.

    That message is read by a user -- the recovery card shows it under its own
    "Can't connect to <provider>" heading -- and which shape it arrives in turns
    on something the provider decided: discovery records the error's ``__cause__``
    when there is one, so a provider that raised ``ProviderUnavailableError``
    without a ``from`` clause surfaces the whole generic message instead of the
    bare reason its neighbours surface. The reason is recovered from that shape

    It is the only account of an outage available before the provider's next
    poll, which is exactly the window in which the recovery surfaces are raised
