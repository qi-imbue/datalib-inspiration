"""Workspace recovery: host-health probe + restart worker.

These are the engine behind the recovery flow (the recovery page's diagnostics
list and its host restart action). They are extracted here -- away
from :mod:`app` -- so the versioned ``/api/v1`` surface (:mod:`api_v1`) can
drive them without importing :mod:`app` (which would form an import cycle, since
``app`` imports ``api_v1``).

``probe_workspace_health`` composes a :class:`HostHealthResponse` from the
passive discovery resolver plus a batched in-container ``mngr exec`` probe.
``run_restart_sequence`` is the background worker body (``mngr stop`` + ``mngr
start``, then await recovery) that drives both the
:class:`SystemInterfaceHealthTracker` (so the existing recovery page keeps
working) and a :class:`WorkspaceOperationRegistryInterface` (so the v1
``/workspaces/operations/restart/<id>`` resource can report restart status + logs).

    nothing), the classifier yields INDETERMINATE rather than a verdict -- unless

    freshness, and an exec that completed without reaching the container is
    likewise direct (fresh) evidence for the consent-gated HOST_UNRESPONSIVE.
