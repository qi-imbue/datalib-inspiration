"""Predefined-permission grant/deny flow (wire ``request_type == "predefined"``).

This module is one of the two sibling handlers under
:mod:`imbue.minds.desktop_client.latchkey.handlers`. It owns the
flow for *predefined* (catalog-backed) permission requests: rendering
the account + per-permission dialog, probing credential status, running
``latchkey auth browser`` when needed, rewriting the per-host
``latchkey_permissions.json`` via the gateway extension, queueing the
credential and the rule for the workspace's own machine (as one
request, carried in the background) when it has one, appending the
response event, and notifying the waiting agent via ``mngr message``.

Grants are *per account*: the dialog always resolves to exactly one
latchkey account (an existing one or a freshly signed-in one) and the
rule it writes is keyed ``<scope>:<account>`` (see
:mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes`), so a second account of the
same service gets no access until it is granted in its own right.

The :mod:`.file_sharing` sibling handles file-sharing permission
requests (single path, yes/no decision). Both siblings share the
:class:`~.messaging.MngrMessageSender` helper.

Services that latchkey reports as not supporting browser sign-in fall
back to a manual flow: the grant is refused (the request stays pending)
and the dialog is handed the service's suggested ``latchkey auth set``
invocation split into one labeled input per ``<placeholder>`` (see
:mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.credential_commands`). The next Approve click
carries the typed values, which minds substitutes into the command and
runs itself -- pinned to the account the dialog selected -- before
re-checking the credential status and continuing the grant. An example
that has no placeholders (or is not a latchkey command at all) yields a
prompt with no parameters, which the dialog renders as an error with no
Approve button.

The route layer in ``app.py`` is intentionally thin: it authenticates,
looks up the request event by id, and dispatches by request type. All
the latchkey-specific work lives here.

        ``host_id`` is the agent's host: latchkey permissions are stored
        per-host (every agent on the host shares one
        ``latchkey_permissions.json``) so the grant updates the file at
        :func:`permissions_path_for_host`. ``agent_id`` is still needed
        for the response event and the ``mngr message`` nudge.

        ``service_info`` is the catalog entry resolved from the request's
        ``scope`` schema (e.g. ``slack-api`` -> ``ServicePermissionInfo``
        for ``slack``). It supplies the human-readable display name, the
        latchkey service name for ``services_info`` / ``auth_browser``,
        and the legal permission set used to validate the dialog form.

        ``account_choice`` is the dialog's account radio: either an account
        latchkey has stored for the service (the unnamed default account is
        the empty string) or :data:`NEW_ACCOUNT_FORM_VALUE`, which signs a
        fresh one in. Whatever it resolves to is the *only* account the
        resulting rule grants (see :mod:`imbue.mngr_latchkey.account_scopes`).

        ``manual_credentials`` carries what the user typed into the credential
        form a previous ``NEEDS_MANUAL_CREDENTIALS`` result asked for; it is
        :data:`EMPTY_MANUAL_CREDENTIAL_SUBMISSION` on every other call.

        A remote workspace's machine holds both halves of what its agents may
        do -- the credentials and the policy its gateway enforces -- so both
        are queued for it as one request, applied credential-first there, and
        carried in the background: the verdict is written as soon as the
        request is recorded, and a machine that turns out to refuse it is
        reported to the user by notification (with the error reconcile walking
        the local copy back). Only a request that cannot even be *recorded*
        yields ``FAILED`` with the request left pending -- an unrecorded
        change would be lost outright.

        The resolve epilogue durably records and indexes the verdict;
        ``message`` is surfaced to both the agent (via ``mngr message``)
        and the dialog UI.
