"""Manage the Cloudflare tunnel token in a running agent's secrets directory.

Lives in its own module (rather than alongside the ``/api/v1`` router)
because the callers -- the Cloudflare tunnel sharing-handler flow, the
workspace-association handler, and the workspace-disassociation handler in
``app.py`` -- need these helpers but are not themselves REST endpoints, and
routing them through the router module made the dependency graph
unnecessarily fan-shaped.

The token lives at ``data/.secrets/cloudflare_tunnel.env`` inside the agent.
``data/.secrets/`` is a directory of per-secret ``*.env`` files (this token,
``restic.env`` for backups); each writer owns its
own file so they never clobber one another. The agent's cloudflare-tunnel
service (``system/services/cloudflare_tunnel/.../runner.py``) watches this file: it starts
cloudflared when the token appears and stops it when the file is removed.
