"""App-global health watchdog for the minds discovery pipeline.

The discovery pipeline is two processes: a *producer* (``mngr observe
--discovery-only``, a grandchild of the detached ``mngr latchkey forward``
supervisor, which writes the shared discovery-events file on each poll cycle) and a
*consumer* (the single ``mngr forward --observe-via-file`` subprocess minds
spawns, which tails that file and folds snapshots into
``MngrCliBackendResolver``). When snapshots stop arriving the resolver freezes
at its last-known state: the workspace list, host-liveness dots, and the
freshness-gated recovery redirect all stop updating, and (in the worst case)
agent traffic stops flowing.

This watchdog detects that and tries to self-heal. It is driven by two inputs,
fed from a background loop and the consumer's lifecycle watcher respectively:

- *Producer stall* -- the producer is emitting nothing. The stall signal is the
  age of the resolver's ``last_event_at`` (its most recent discovery event of
  *any* kind), not its last *full snapshot*. A full snapshot bumps both, so
  ``last_event_at >= last_full_snapshot_at`` always; keying off events means a
  producer that is alive and emitting incremental updates but slow to complete a
  full re-poll (e.g. one provider is down) reads as *healthy*, not stalled --
  only a producer emitting literally nothing trips the watchdog. (A dead
  supervisor manifests the same way -- its ``mngr observe`` grandchild stops
  emitting, so events stop -- so the freshness signal covers it without a
  separate liveness probe.) On a stall it ``bounce``\\ es once (SIGHUP
  the observe child -- or, if the supervisor is dead, start it; gateway +
  reverse tunnels untouched), then issues repeated ``restart``\\ s (full
  supervisor restart -- fixes a wedged supervisor) on a capped exponential
  backoff. It **never gives up**: a stall keeps the app in ``RECONNECTING`` and
  keeps retrying forever (a failed ``restart`` is just another "did not help").
  The backoff is deliberate: ``restart`` re-provisions every
  managed host, so blindly hammering a merely-slow producer would make things
  worse.
- *Consumer death* -- the consumer subprocess exited. Producer remediation
  cannot fix a dead consumer (and respawning the consumer is out of scope), so
  this transitions straight to the terminal ``BLOCKED`` tier. This is the *only*
  path to ``BLOCKED``.

The watchdog never touches the consumer subprocess: it is also the HTTP traffic
proxy, and its bound port is baked into app state / ``AgentCreator`` / the
Electron shell, so respawning it is heavyweight and risks a port rebind.

Health is a three-state machine surfaced to the chrome:

- ``HEALTHY`` -- pipeline fresh; nothing surfaced.
- ``RECONNECTING`` -- producer stall detected; remediation is healing in the
  background and keeps retrying indefinitely. The currently-loaded workspace
  still works, so nothing is surfaced (the providers panel's "time since last
  discovery" counter is the only passive signal); this state never escalates to
  the error-takeover screen.
- ``BLOCKED`` -- the consumer died: forwarding is down / the app is unusable, so
  the chrome redirects the whole app to an error-takeover screen. ``BLOCKED`` is
  terminal -- it stays until the user restarts the app -- and is reached *only*
  via consumer death, never from a producer stall.

State changes fire registered on-change callbacks, invoked outside the internal
lock so they may take the FastAPI app's own locks without deadlocking.
