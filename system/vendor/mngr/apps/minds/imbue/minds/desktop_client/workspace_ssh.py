"""Authorize temporary SSH access into a workspace, from the minds hub.

The "source workspace is still online" recovery route: a calling workspace
generates its own keypair and sends only its *public* key here. The hub appends
that key to the target workspace's ``authorized_keys`` (via ``mngr exec``),
tagged with the requester and a short expiry so it can be pruned later, and
returns the target's SSH connection info. The caller then connects directly with
its own private key and runs ordinary ``git`` / ``rsync`` / ``ssh``.

Private keys never move: the hub only ever handles public keys. Grants are
ephemeral -- each authorized key carries an ``expires=`` marker so that stale
grants can be pruned. ``prune_expired_grant_lines`` implements that pruning over
an ``authorized_keys`` body, and ``compose_pruned_authorized_keys`` combines it
with the new grant line in a single rewrite. The grant flow (see the route)
reads the target's ``authorized_keys`` back over ``mngr exec``, prunes expired
minds-owned lines, and writes the pruned body plus the new grant, so stale
grants never accumulate across repeated requests.

For a *remote* target (Modal / AWS / Vultr / imbue_cloud), the returned host is
reachable from anywhere, so the caller connects directly. A *local* target
(Docker / Lima) publishes its sshd only on the hub's loopback, so the hub brokers
a reverse tunnel into the caller's container (see ``workspace_ssh_tunnel`` and the
route) and returns a ``127.0.0.1:<port>`` endpoint the caller connects to.
