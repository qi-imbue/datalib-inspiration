"""Laptop-side environment signals: sleep, and connectivity from this device.

Minds convicts a workspace of being stuck by watching it fail to answer, and
then acts on that conviction by restarting it. Both steps quietly assume the
laptop was awake and on a working network the whole time. On a laptop neither
holds often enough to matter: the lid closes mid-outage-check and every
background loop stops dead; the wifi drops on a train and every remote machine
stops answering at once; a corporate or hotel network passes HTTP but blocks
outbound SSH, so the browser works while nothing minds does can reach a host.
Each of those reads, through the machinery downstream, as the workspace dying.

This module supplies the two facts that separate the device's condition from the
workspace's: which wall-clock windows this process spent not running
(:class:`SleepTracker`), and whether this device can currently reach anything at
all (:class:`ConnectivityDetector`). Neither ever asserts health. A signal here
may suppress a negative verdict or withhold an action; nothing here can make a
workspace read as healthy, and an *unknown* reading -- the state right after a
wake, before any probe has landed -- suppresses nothing at all. Workspaces
dialled on this device are exempt from the connectivity signals entirely (which
machines those are is decided from the address minds connects to, by the
recovery paths that apply the rule); the sleep signal still applies to them,
because the probe loop was frozen regardless of where the machine lives.

Sleep is detected by heartbeat rather than by a platform sleep/wake
notification. ``SleepTracker`` ticks about once a second and compares
consecutive wall-clock readings; a gap far larger than the tick is a window in
which the loop was not scheduled. That covers system sleep, and equally covers a
process suspended by anything else (SIGSTOP, a hypervisor pause), which is the
same fact for every consumer here.

The Electron shell is the road not taken, deliberately. It already subscribes to
``powerMonitor``'s ``resume`` and ``unlock-screen`` (``electron/main.js``), and
relaying those to this process would be a handful of lines. Three reasons not
to: that signal names the wake but not the window, so the tracker would still
need its own record of when the process stopped; it does not exist at all in
browser mode or for any of the non-sleep suspensions above; and it would make
a laptop-side correctness property depend on an IPC hop that can be missed,
where the heartbeat's absence *is* the evidence. Worth revisiting only if the
heartbeat proves noisy in the field, and then as corroboration rather than as a
replacement.

The heartbeat can be trusted to bound *elapsed* time because ``time.monotonic``
cannot: it freezes across sleep on macOS (a measured ~1-3s of advance across two
~15-minute lid-closed sleeps on Apple Silicon), so a monotonic deadline set
before the lid closed silently extends itself across the sleep. Wall clock is
the only reading that spans it. The two are recorded together anyway, because
their difference is what distinguishes a real sleep (wall advanced, monotonic
did not) from a merely-starved process (both advanced), and that distinction is
worth having in the log when a gap is being explained after the fact.

Connectivity is measured on demand and never in the background. Nothing here
polls the network to keep a reading warm: a probe runs when some consumer is
about to act on the answer, and then repeatedly only while a bad reading is
outstanding, until it clears. Steady state is silence.

The SSH facet asks about the endpoints minds itself dials, supplied by whoever
constructs the detector. It has to: minds' machines are not on port 22 -- an
imbue_cloud host answers on a port its box forwarded, somewhere in the
22000-32000 range -- so a public :22 check would measure a port those machines
never use, in both directions. Public SSH is still probed, but only to break the
tie when none of minds' own endpoints answer, which is the one case the
endpoints cannot resolve alone: every machine failing is either the network or
those machines, and a public host still serving SSH says it was the machines.

        the whole probe's worst case above the concurrency group's exit budget,
        and it is what a quit landing mid-round has to wait out.

        The addresses are still tried in turn, because that is what makes a host
        reachable at all when its first address family is not routable from
        here. What changes is that they share one deadline, and that each takes
        an equal share of what is left of it (:func:`_address_attempt_seconds`)
        -- otherwise one that blackholes spends the lot and the walk is a walk
        in name only.

        Returns the connected socket, which the caller owns, or None when no
        address answered -- refused, unreachable, unopenable, or still silent
        when its share of the budget ran out. Raises what resolution raises; the
        callers report that as the endpoint not answering.

        The budget starts once the addresses are in hand. Charging resolution to
        it would bound nothing -- ``getaddrinfo`` blocks for as long as it blocks
        either way -- while a lookup slower than the budget would leave nothing
        to connect with, reporting a reachable endpoint as unreachable. An
        uncached lookup right after a reassociation is exactly when this runs.

        workspace endpoint and the three public hosts was measured at 9.25s
        against a 1.5s budget that was then per *connection*, so one multi-homed
        public host spent it once per resolved address; the budget is the
        endpoint's now (:meth:`SocketNetworkProber._connect_within_budget`).

        The trade is that every endpoint is now asked even when the first would
        have settled it. The wall clock is the slowest single endpoint either
        way; what it costs is connections, on the path where the answer is good
        and nothing is waiting on it.

        Each endpoint re-checks the shutdown before dialling (see
        :meth:`_ask_ssh_endpoint`), so a quit landing mid-round still opens no
        connection it has not already opened. A round abandoned that way reads as
        "nothing answered", which is why every caller re-checks
        :meth:`_is_shutting_down` before believing it.

        Asks minds' *own* endpoints first, because they are the only ones whose
        answer is the question: a machine's host is reached on whatever port its
        provider forwarded, and for imbue_cloud that is a box-forwarded port in
        the 22000-32000 range rather than 22. One of them answering settles it --
        the network passes what minds needs, whatever it does to port 22.

        When none of them answer, the public quorum breaks the tie that the
        endpoints alone cannot. Every one of minds' machines failing has two
        explanations, and only one of them is the network: if a public host
        still serves an SSH banner, SSH leaves this device fine and those
        machines are simply unreachable for reasons of their own -- so the facet
        stays ONLINE and the recovery paths go on treating it as a machine
        problem, which is what it is. Only when the public quorum fails too is
        this network blocking SSH.

        With no endpoints known the quorum answers alone, which is all there is
        to go on. It still speaks either way: the facet feeds the app-level
        notice, so a network that blocks :22 is named on a device that may have
        nothing on the far side of it. What it gates depends on why the
        endpoints are missing. With no remote machines there is no dispatch to
        withhold. With discovery not yet reporting there can be -- a machine
        whose coordinate discovery has not supplied is probed as failing and can
        reach STUCK, and counts as network-dependent -- so its start is withheld
        on a quorum-only verdict. That is the conservative direction this module
        takes everywhere: it costs a wait that the network returning ends,
        against dispatching over a network that cannot carry it.
