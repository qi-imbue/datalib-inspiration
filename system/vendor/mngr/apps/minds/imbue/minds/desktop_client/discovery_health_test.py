"""Unit tests for the discovery-pipeline health watchdog state machine.

The watchdog is driven with a fake clock (so the backoff waits and the stall
threshold are deterministic) and a fake producer remediator (so the
bounce/restart remediations can be asserted without a
real supervisor). The background loop that calls ``evaluate`` in production is
exercised separately; here we call ``evaluate`` / ``record_consumer_death``
directly.
