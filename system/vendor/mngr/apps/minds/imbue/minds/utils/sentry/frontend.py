"""Frontend (web-UI / browser) Sentry configuration for the desktop client.

The Python backend reports errors to Sentry via ``setup_sentry`` in
:mod:`imbue.minds.utils.sentry.core`. The browser-side web UI served by the
backend (the JinjaX pages under ``desktop_client/templates`` rendered through
``Base.jinja``) reports its own JavaScript errors to Sentry too, using the
vendored ``@sentry/browser`` bundle (``static/sentry.browser.min.js``) booted
by ``static/sentry_init.js``.

The Python backend reports to its own (Python) Sentry projects; all of minds'
**JavaScript** -- both this browser web UI and the Electron main process
(``electron/sentry.js``) -- reports to one shared set of **JavaScript** Sentry
projects (production / staging / dev). Backend and frontend stay on separate
projects because a single Sentry project is tied to one platform (its issue
grouping, source-map handling, and release-health UI are all platform-specific),
so mixing a Python SDK and a JavaScript SDK into one project is discouraged even
though the ingest endpoint technically accepts both. The browser and Electron
main process, however, are both JavaScript and happily share one project set.

The browser web UI reports automatic JavaScript errors, so it is gated by the
same per-machine user setting as the backend's automatic error reporting
(``report_unexpected_errors`` in :class:`MindsConfig`, surfaced via the
first-launch consent screen and account settings). The caller passes that
setting in as ``is_error_reporting_enabled``; the environment selection
(activated minds env -> production / staging / development) is shared with the
backend via :mod:`imbue.minds.utils.sentry.core`, so the backend and the
frontend report under the same environment, release, and ``git_sha`` tag.
