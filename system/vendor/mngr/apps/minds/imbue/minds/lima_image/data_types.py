      Nothing is wrong with the image and the slow path still works, so build in-VM; the
      prefetch keeps retrying in the background.
    - ``UNTRUSTED``: a published image did not *verify* -- its signature or hash does not
      match what the manifest names. Those bytes are never booted and the create fails loudly:
      silently building in-VM would paper over someone serving an image we cannot vouch for.
