"""Resolve the minds desktop app version + git SHA for Sentry release tagging.

The Electron launcher (``electron/backend.js``) passes both values to the
Python backend via environment variables on every spawn -- both for dev runs
(``just minds-start`` -> ``pnpm start`` -> ``electron .``) and for packaged
builds. The launcher is the source of truth:

* ``MINDS_RELEASE_ID`` -- the desktop app version from ``package.json``.
* ``MINDS_GIT_SHA`` -- the git SHA the code was cut from: resolved live from
  the checkout in dev, and baked into ``electron/build-info.json`` at build
  time for packaged builds.

The fallbacks below only matter for a bare ``uv run minds run`` started without
the launcher: ``release_id`` is read from the in-repo ``package.json``, and the
git SHA degrades to ``"unknown"`` (product code does not shell out to git).
