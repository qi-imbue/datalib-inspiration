"""Sweep R2 buckets whose owning account no longer exists.

Imbue-cloud backups provision one R2 bucket per workspace, named
``<user_id_prefix>--<host_id>`` (see the connector's ``make_bucket_name``).
Nothing ever deleted them: ``minds env destroy`` tears down the Modal env,
Neon DB, SuperTokens app and Cloudflare *tunnels*, but not the buckets a CI
env's test accounts created. Every CI run that exercises imbue-cloud backups
therefore leaked a bucket, forever.

Identifying a leaked bucket safely is the whole problem: **the dev and CI
tiers share one Cloudflare account**, so a developer's own backup buckets sit
right next to the CI leftovers, and deleting by age or by name pattern would
eat a colleague's backups. The rule used here is *positive* rather than
heuristic:

    a bucket is sweepable only when its owner prefix matches NO user in ANY
    SuperTokens app on the core those tiers authenticate against.

CI test accounts live in a per-run ``ci-*`` SuperTokens app that is destroyed
with the env, so their buckets become provably ownerless. A developer's user
persists in their ``dev-*`` app, so their buckets are never candidates. The
sweep fails closed: any error enumerating apps/users, or an empty protected
set, aborts before deleting anything (a transient SuperTokens outage must
never be read as "nobody owns these buckets").

Cloudflare refuses to delete a non-empty bucket, so each bucket is emptied
first over R2's S3-compatible API, using S3 credentials derived from the
account token exactly as the connector does (access key = token id, secret =
SHA-256 of the token value).
