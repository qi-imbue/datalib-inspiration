"""Pool-hosts SQL migration runner with a real ``schema_migrations`` tracking table.

Replaces the previous "replay every .sql with ``IF NOT EXISTS`` guards"
pattern. The schema_migrations table records ``(version, applied_at)``
per migration filename; the runner only applies files whose name is not
yet in the table. New migrations should NOT use ``IF NOT EXISTS``
guards -- the tracking table is the source of truth for which migrations
have already run.

Backwards-compat: on the first run against an existing database that
was migrated under the old "replay-everything" pattern, the
schema_migrations table doesn't exist but the schema does. The runner
creates the table and then attempts every on-disk file in order; because
the existing files all use ``IF NOT EXISTS`` guards, replaying them
against the already-migrated database is a no-op (and gets recorded as
applied). New (post-this-change) migrations don't carry guards, so a
missing record means the migration has genuinely never run + needs to.

Shells out to ``psql`` for every operation (DDL + reads + applies)
rather than pulling in psycopg2; matches the existing
``neon_db.wipe_neon_db_schema`` pattern and avoids a new transitive
dependency.
