# at startup (``imbue.minds.bootstrap``) and to populate the create form's AWS
# region dropdown (``imbue.minds.desktop_client.region_preference``). minds
# deliberately exposes only the US datacenters by default: every configured
# region adds a provider that ``mngr list`` fans out to on each discovery
# cycle, and the non-US regions roughly doubled listing latency for little
# benefit to the current user base. ``mngr_aws`` still ships pinned default
# AMIs for more regions, so this set can be widened later without other
# changes; any region added here must have an AMI in ``mngr_aws`` or it would
# fail AMI resolution at create time. Lives in ``primitives`` (which never
