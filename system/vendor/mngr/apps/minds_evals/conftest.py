# never collect from them.
collect_ignore = ["datasets", "jobs"]

# The ROOT pytest run loads the conftests under this app too: `testpaths = ["apps/*"]` hands pytest
# this directory as an explicit argument, and the root conftest's `collect_ignore_glob` stops it
# from collecting the files below but not from descending the directories, so every conftest it
# meets on the way is imported. So every import at the top of a conftest here must resolve in the
# root venv, which has no harbor -- and nearly every `imbue.minds_evals` module imports harbor.
# `imbue/minds_evals/conftest.py` states the full bar; an import that misses it aborts every
# root-level run at collection.

    """Every message logged while the test runs, in order, interpolated.

    loguru writes to its own sinks rather than through `logging`, so pytest's `caplog` never sees
    it and a test that asserts on a log line has to add a sink and remove it again. The sink is
    global, so a test that raised between the two would leak it into every test after it; that is
    what this fixture's teardown is for.

    Captured from TRACE up, whatever level the caller cares about: the assertions are searches
    over the list, so the quieter records around the one being looked for cost nothing.
