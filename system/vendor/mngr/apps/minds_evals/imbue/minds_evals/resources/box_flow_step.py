"""One UI-flow step, executed in the box against the delivered app's forwarded origin.

Runs as a one-shot process per step: connects to the long-lived headless Chromium over CDP,
performs the requested action, captures the page, and prints a single JSON object on stdout. The
browser outlives it, so cookies, storage and the open page persist across steps without this script
holding any state or the driver holding a long-lived command protocol.

Uploaded into the box at trial time rather than baked into the image (the box_reverse_tunnel.py
pattern), so iterating on it never rebuilds the box image. flow_step_protocol.py, which
carries the request and result models both sides share, is uploaded beside it.

Invoked as: box_flow_step.py '<json StepRequest>'
Every outcome -- including failure -- is reported as a StepResult on stdout, because the caller
classifies by the reported reason and a traceback on stderr would read as a bridge failure instead.
