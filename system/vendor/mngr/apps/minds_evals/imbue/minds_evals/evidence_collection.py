"""The trial-time evidence collection phase: everything that needs the workspace alive.

The verifier is a separate container that runs after the trial, by which time the nested workspace
sandbox has been destroyed. So anything that needs the live app -- the app registry, supervisord, an
HTTP probe, the agent's own tests -- is captured here, into ``/logs/agent/verification/``, and the
grade-time criteria score the *recorded* results. That split is what keeps ``harbor trial regrade``
cheap and pure: the unrepeatable half is captured once, the scoring policy can evolve.

Everything is written incrementally, so a phase that crashes or runs out of budget still leaves the
evidence collected up to that point. Every manifest entry carries a status where ``failed`` means the
workspace fell short and ``error`` means the harness could not find out -- an agent must never score
zero because the measuring instrument broke.

      program name for a ``--manifest`` registration). It covers a template app whose service is

      app registers extra origin-label rows that correspond to no directory at all.
