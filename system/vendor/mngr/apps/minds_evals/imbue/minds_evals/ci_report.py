"""Render the Slack report of a scheduled run: a message per pair, holding a grid of case by config,
the trials that failed, and a collapsed table of every judge score behind them.

Only the blocks an incoming webhook actually accepts are used. A webhook refuses `data_table`
outright -- a minimal one is answered with 400 invalid_blocks -- so the sorting and paging it would
bring are not available here, and `container` is what keeps the long table out of the way instead.
`markdown` is refused as well. Both would need an app posting with a bot token rather than a
webhook, so do not reach for either without changing how the notify job posts.

A scheduled run evaluates arms -- a frozen (mngr, dwt) pair times a named harness config -- and this
is everything anyone reads about it. Each pair gets a message of its own, because the pairs answer
different questions ("is what we are about to ship healthy?" and "is what users are running
healthy?") and a reader acts on one of them at a time.

Every message carries a plain mrkdwn `text` beside its blocks. Slack shows that wherever the blocks
cannot be rendered, the workflow re-posts it on its own if Slack refuses a block, and it is what the
run writes to its step summary -- so it has to read as a whole report rather than as a caption.

The report has two inputs, and both are read as things that may not be there: the decided matrix,
which a run that broke early never wrote, and the per-pass summary files, which a job that died
before grading never uploaded.

Nothing here raises on a bad input file. This report is the whole notification of a run, so an
unreadable file is reported as unreadable, in wording that never reads as a pass that got nowhere:
"the summary could not be read" and "the job failed before grading" are different failures, and
reporting the first as the second sends the reader to the wrong place.
