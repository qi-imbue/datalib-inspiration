"""A scripted VerificationAgent for the tests of the UI-flow loop.

The loop's behaviour is a function of what the agent decides and what the step script reports, so
scripting the decisions holds one of those two still and no test of it needs an API call. Both tests
that drive the loop use this: the collector's pair it with the scripted box environment, which holds
the other half still too, and the flow lab's leave a real browser to answer so what the executor
reports is the only thing under test. Actions and readings are consumed in order across the whole
run; the last entry repeats, so a test that only cares about the first few decisions does not have
to pad the script to the step cap.
