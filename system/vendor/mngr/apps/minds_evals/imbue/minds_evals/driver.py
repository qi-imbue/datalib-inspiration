"""MindsPersonaDriver: a host-side harbor agent that owns the whole persona conversation loop.

The harbor environment is the Minds box; the driver starts the backend with per-trial env, creates
one nested Modal workspace through the production Minds API, drives the scripted multi-turn
conversation against the workspace's chat app (bridged through ``mngr exec``), snapshots the
workspace after turns, and keeps the ATIF ``trajectory.json`` (what the verifier grades) and
``state.json`` current in the box so even a timed-out trial leaves a gradeable partial record.
