"""The message-length guard: the fraction of the agent's turns whose messages stay inside the limits
a client-facing turn is expected to keep. It is one of the equal-weight `quality` criteria,
alongside the judged ones, and is not a hard gate. Runs in the verifier container: stdlib +
rewardkit only, absolute paths.

A turn has a shape, not just a size. The messages before the last one are status updates the client
reads in passing while the agent works, so they are held to a short line; the last message is the
turn's answer -- what was delivered, how to use it, what the client has to decide -- and is allowed
real length. Scoring each message against the limit for its position, rather than averaging the turn,
is what keeps the measurement about how the agent writes instead of about how the work happened to
divide across turns: an agent that gates on a mock-up delivers in its second turn and an agent that
does not delivers in its first, and both are keeping the same discipline.

The score is the fraction of turns that keep it, so one overlong turn in three costs a third rather
than the whole criterion.

Which message ends a turn is recorded, not inferred: the workspace's own document marks it with a
terminal `finish_reason`, where every interim message carries a non-terminal one (`tool_use`, or pi's
`toolUse`). That distinction is
load-bearing for a turn the trial cut short, whose last recorded message is a status line rather than
an answer -- position would grade it as the turn's answer and let 300 words through. Position is the
fallback for a turn that marks nothing, which is the driver's hand-built trajectory: there a turn is
a single merged step, so it has no interim messages and only the final-message limit applies.

The limits below are the whole configuration: the bar is a property of the writing rather than of the
eval config, and it is per message so that a wall of text cannot be paid for by the terse messages
around it. The driver's own `average_words_per_turn` and `average_words_per_message` are recorded in
the trial metadata for observability only; nothing at grade time reads either.
