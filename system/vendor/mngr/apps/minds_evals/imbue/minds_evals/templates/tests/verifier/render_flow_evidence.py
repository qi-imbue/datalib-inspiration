"""Flatten the UI-flow evidence into the two shapes rewardkit's judge can actually read.

rewardkit inlines a judge's `files` list with no recursion: a listed directory contributes its
immediate FILES only, sorted by path. The collected evidence is nested one level deeper
(`verification/flows/<name>/step_003.png`), so a pre-step has to flatten it. Running at grade time
rather than in the driver is what lets `harbor trial regrade` re-score captured trials under a
changed selection or digest format.

Two rules drive the layout, both from how rewardkit renders a `files` entry:

- A listed path that does not exist renders a literal ``[not found]`` block into the judge's prompt.
  Both outputs here are therefore created unconditionally -- an oracle run or a case with no flows
  gets an empty screenshots directory and a digest that says so, never a missing-file marker.
- A listed directory that is EMPTY renders nothing at all, not even a header. That is why the digest
  is a separate always-present file and states the screenshot count explicitly: without it the judge
  could not tell "flows ran but captured no usable shot" from "no flows were declared".

Runs in the verifier container: stdlib only, absolute paths.
