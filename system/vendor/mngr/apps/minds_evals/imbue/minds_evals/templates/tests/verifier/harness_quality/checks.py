"""The scripted half of `harness_quality`: score each scope on how many harness failure signatures its
trajectory contained, with no model in the loop.

The judges beside these criteria read prose and can weigh "hit a missing plugin, tried twice, worked
around it" against "gave up and shipped nothing". That judgement is worth having, and it is also
arguable. These counts are not: a run whose tool output says `Unknown skill:` said it, however well the
agent coped afterwards. Scoring both means a harness regression shows up even in the runs where the
agent papered over it.

The score decays as ``half_marks_at / (half_marks_at + count)``: 1.0 for a clean scope, half marks at
the configured count, approaching but never reaching zero. It never reaches zero on purpose -- a
trajectory is a sample of what the harness did, and no finite count of signatures proves that nothing
worked. Decay also keeps the criterion discriminating at the bad end, where a linear budget would floor
every badly-broken run at the same 0. Counts come from harness_failures.json, written by
render_harness_report.py in the same pre-step pass.

These criteria only ever run on a claude trajectory: the report they and the judges score is built by
claude-shaped rules, so on any other harness it is thin for want of those rules rather than for want
of friction, and that same pre-step removes this whole dimension there. See
render_harness_report.py::is_harness_quality_applicable.

Runs in the verifier container: stdlib + rewardkit only, absolute paths.
