"""Render the message-by-message transcript the judges score, at GRADE time, from the trial's ATIF
trajectory. The quality judge grades conciseness per individual agent message, so it must see each
agent step as its own block -- on the workspace's own document that is one block per inference, on
the driver's hand-built fallback one block per turn.

Running here (a verifier pre-step, before rewardkit) rather than in the driver means the rendering is
rebuilt from ``/logs/agent/trajectory.json`` on every grade, so ``harbor trial regrade`` re-scores
captured trials under the current rendering with no conversation re-run.

The rendering keeps only the real back-and-forth: one ``[USER]`` block per ``user`` step, one
``[AGENT · message N]`` block per ``agent`` step with a non-empty message (N running across the whole
conversation), and one ``[PROGRESS · ...]`` block per progress-view step record the agent declared or
closed. A message's inline images are reduced to ``[image: <alt>]``, because the chat renders them as
pictures and the markdown path around them is markup the client never reads. ``system`` steps
(framework-injected text, compaction summaries) and steps that carry no message are not client-facing
speech and are omitted. Runs in the verifier container: stdlib only, absolute paths.

Progress-view records are the second thing the client reads. The agent manages its work with `tk`,
whose ``--step`` records render as nodes on the chat's progress timeline: a title when the step is
declared and a one-line summary when it closes. Both are user-facing copy under the same plain-language
rule as the messages, and neither appears in any ``message`` field, so a transcript built from messages
alone leaves that copy ungraded. They are read from `tk`'s own machine-readable output rather than by
parsing the shell command: ``Created wor-step-<id>: <title>`` for a declaration and the
``tk-step <id> title:`` / ``tk-step <id> summary:`` pair `tk close` prints. Both are keyed to the step
record's own identity -- the ``wor-step-`` id shape, and the ``tk-step`` marker -- so cross-agent
ticket text, which is not written for the client, stays out of the judged transcript even when a
single inference creates a step record and a ticket together. The lines being read are these::

    Created wor-step-qa7d: Set up the to-do app so it can open as a tab
    Updated wor-step-qa7d -> closed
    tk-step wor-step-qa7d title: Set up the to-do app so it can open as a tab
    tk-step wor-step-qa7d summary: Set up the app's plumbing so it runs and can appear as a tab.

Only the top-level ``steps`` array is walked, never the ``subagent_trajectories`` embedded in it: a
subagent's steps are its own bookkeeping and never reach the client's timeline, so grading the client-
facing copy on them would charge the agent for text the client never saw.
