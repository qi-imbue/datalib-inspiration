"""Render the harness reports the `harness_quality` judges read, and count the failure signatures its
programmatic criteria score, at GRADE time from the trial's ATIF trajectories.

`harness_quality` asks a different question from the other dimensions: not how well the agent worked,
but whether the workspace it was given actually let it work. A skill that will not load, a plugin the
session cannot resolve, a browser the tests cannot find -- these look like agent failures in every
other dimension, because the agent visibly does not do the thing it said it would. Separating them
keeps a broken workspace from being scored as a bad agent, and makes a harness regression legible on
its own axis.

Two reports are written, because the two scopes fail differently and are fixed by different people:

- ``harness_main.txt`` from ``/logs/agent/trajectory.json`` -- the workspace agent the client talks to.
- ``harness_workers.txt`` from every ``/logs/agent/verification/workers/<name>/trajectory.json`` -- the
  agents it launched. Hardening, review gates and crystallization run here, so this is where a missing
  plugin usually bites.

Both are *processed*: a raw trajectory runs to hundreds of KB and would not fit a judge prompt, and
most of it is ordinary work. Each report keeps only the steps that bear on whether the harness held --
skill invocations, errored tool results, and anything matching a known failure signature -- with the
agent's own words for that step, so the judge can see whether the agent recovered or gave up.

Only output a tool actually *produced by running something* is classified, plus any errored result:
file contents an agent read and prose a subagent wrote quote the strings a broken harness prints, and
counting those scores an agent for the documentation it consulted.

The ``harness_quality`` dimension is claude-only, and this pass is what enforces that: see
``prepare_harness_quality``. The reports themselves are still written on every harness -- most of
what they classify is harness-blind, and they are the only grade-time record of what the workspace
did to the agent even where nothing scores them.

``harness_failures.json`` carries the scripted side: per-scope counts of each signature, and the
``scored_total`` that ``harness_quality/checks.py`` scores without a model in the loop. The judge reads
prose and can weigh "tried three times and worked around it" against "gave up"; the counts cannot be
argued with. Neither is sufficient alone. Not every signature is scored -- see UNCOUNTED_SIGNATURES --
but all of them stay in the report, because a path the agent probed for and did not find is context
the judge should have even when it is not evidence of a broken harness.

Runs in the verifier container: stdlib only, absolute paths.
