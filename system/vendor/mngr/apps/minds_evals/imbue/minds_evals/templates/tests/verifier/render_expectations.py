"""Render the expectations the outcome judge grades against, at GRADE time, from the case config.

The judge needs the case's ground truth in prose: what was commissioned, and which concrete checks
the harness recorded against it. Rendering here (a verifier pre-step, before rewardkit) rather than
in the driver means ``harbor trial regrade`` re-scores captured trials under the current rendering.

Runs in the verifier container: stdlib only, absolute paths. Cases with no expectations have no
tests/outcome/ directory, so test.sh never invokes this.
