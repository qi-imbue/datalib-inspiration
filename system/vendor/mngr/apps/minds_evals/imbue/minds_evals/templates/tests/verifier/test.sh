# rewardkit owns all judging and scoring; finalize.py combines the dimension scores
# (reward = quality, or an even split of quality and outcome, discounted by the harness's
# share of it where that dimension applies, and zeroed unless every gate passed) and
# distinguishes a graded 0.0 from a grading-infrastructure failure (judge API error / no
# parseable reward file / unreadable case file / unmeasurable outcome evidence), leaving
# no reward file in the latter case so harbor errors the trial instead of scoring it 0.

# Rebuild the harness reports and the failure-signature counts the harness_quality dimension scores:
# one processed trajectory per scope (the lead agent, and every captured worker), keeping only the
# steps where a skill was invoked, a tool errored, or output matched a known failure signature. A raw
# trajectory is far too large for a judge prompt and mostly ordinary work.
#
# The same pass settles whether harness_quality applies at all: the report those criteria and their
# judges score is built by claude-shaped rules, so on any other harness it takes the dimension out of
# the criteria tree and records which harness ran in harness.json for finalize.py.

# ground truth, rendered here for the same regrade reason. The flow evidence is flattened here too:
# rewardkit's judge expands a listed directory one level and never recurses, so the nested per-flow
# screenshots and step logs have to be reduced to one flat digest file and one flat image directory.
# Both are written unconditionally -- a path the judge lists but cannot find renders a "[not found]"
# block into the prompt.

# The rewardkit version is exact, not a range: `uvx` resolves in an isolated tool
# environment that honours no cooldown, so a range would let two trials in the
# same run -- or a trial and a later regrade of it -- be graded by different
# builds with nothing in the output to say so. It must equal the dev-group pin in
# pyproject.toml, which is what type-checks these criteria; rewardkit_pin_test
# enforces that.
