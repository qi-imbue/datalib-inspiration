"""The verifier container's rewardkit and this project's dev-group rewardkit are one pin.

``templates/`` runs inside the verifier container, which resolves rewardkit itself
through uvx: the criteria under ``templates/tests/verifier/`` and the ones under
``templates/outcome/`` (copied in beside them for cases that declare expectations)
both import it. The dev group installs it here too -- nothing this project runs
imports it, it is there so the type checker can resolve those criteria. Two separate
installs of the same thing, and only a matching pin makes checking the first tell you
anything about the second.

Where each part of this project is type-checked, and why, is recorded in
``[tool.ty.src]``; the root workspace's half of that split is enforced by
``test_standalone_project_ty_carve_outs_are_checked_by_the_root_workspace`` in
``test_meta_ratchets.py``, which runs on every PR.
