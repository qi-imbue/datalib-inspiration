"""Read a finished harbor job directory and decide whether the run passed.

A scheduled run has to answer one question in one exit code, and the artifacts that answer it are
spread across four files per trial: harbor's own ``result.json`` (did the trial run at all), the
driver's ``agent/state.json`` (did the conversation reach its end, or run out of time -- harbor
grades a timed-out trial as an ordinary result, so nothing else tells the two apart),
``verifier/reward-details.json`` (did the structural gates hold, what did the judges say) and
``agent/verification/manifest.json`` (was anything left unmeasured).

The gate is deliberately narrow. A trial is charged for not running, for failing a structural gate,
and for observably running on a model other than the one its harness config asked for; it is never
charged for a judge score, which is statistical and drifts between runs. An `error` in the evidence
manifest fails the run because it is the harness that broke, not the workspace -- the same `failed`
versus `error` split the collector and the verifier already rest on.
