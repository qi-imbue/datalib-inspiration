# function is spelled two ways -- `tools.exec_command({cmd})` or `tools.shell_command({command})`,
# depending on the codex version and whether its unified exec is on -- so both are read. The
# surrounding program is arbitrary JavaScript rather than JSON, which is why the literal is read out
# with a regex instead of being parsed -- the same approach the chat app's own codex tool labels take.
# This parse is mirrored by the CODE_MODE_* patterns and commands_in in
