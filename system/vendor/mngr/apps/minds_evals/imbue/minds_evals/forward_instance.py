"""The `mngr forward` instance the flow executor drives the delivered app through.

`mngr forward` is what serves a workspace's apps to the client: it binds a loopback port, routes by
Host header, and reaches the workspace over the same per-host SSH tunnel the eval's exec and rsync
already ride. Driving flows through it means the browser sees the app on the product's serving path
rather than under it at a raw in-container socket.

Origins are keyed by AGENT id: the bare `agent-<hex>.localhost` origin serves the shell service and
each registered service owns `<label>.agent-<hex>.localhost`, with one session cookie scoped to the
whole family. The agent id is the coordinate because it survives the agent moving between hosts.

The driver starts its OWN instance rather than discovering the one the headless minds backend may
have spawned: a driver-owned instance has a known port and a known pre-auth token, and does not
couple the eval to backend internals or to a cookie it never minted.

Configured the way minds configures its spawn, so the exercised path is production's. The one
deliberate divergence is `--port`: minds omits it and reads the chosen port back off the readiness
envelope, while a driver-owned instance wants a port it picked, so a conflict is a loud failure
rather than a silent bind somewhere else.
