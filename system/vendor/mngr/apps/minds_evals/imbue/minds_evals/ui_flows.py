"""The verification agent: the reasoning half of UI-flow execution, plus the executor it drives.

A declared flow is natural language ("Add a task named 'buy milk'. Reload the page."), and the app
it runs against was invented by the agent under test, so there are no selectors to script. This
module is the decider's sibling: it renders the flow plus what the browser currently sees into a
prompt, asks a model for the single next browser action, and -- once the declared actions are done -- asks it
what the final page shows. Everything it returns is data; the loop that executes actions and records
each step is `flow_runner.run_flow`, which the evidence collector drives at trial time and the flow
lab drives locally, exactly as the decider's loop lives in the driver.

Reasoning stays host-side on purpose: a loop delegated to the browser would return a bare claim
rather than a stepwise record, and could be neither bounded nor observed. Here every step is
budgeted, logged, and billed to harness spend.

The other half of this module turns decided actions into requests for the box-side executor -- a
headless Chromium driving the app's forwarded origin, its own label on the workspace's agent-keyed
origin, where the proxy serves it -- and classifies what comes back. That classification is what lets a broken instrument (no browser,
no proxy, a dead tunnel, refused TLS) be recorded as ERROR while a broken app is recorded as
FAILED.

    "you expected of it and what the page actually did -- and the current page as its URL, its "
    "title and its accessibility tree. Choose the SINGLE next action.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Address an element by the ARIA role and accessible name the current page state gives it, spelled "
    "exactly as the tree spells them. Never invent a name the page does not show. An element the tree "
    "lists with no name at all (e.g. `- checkbox [ref=e9]`) is addressed by its ref instead: give the "
    "role and the ref, and leave target empty. Use a ref for nothing else -- a control with no name is "
    "recorded as such.\n"
    "- Do exactly what the declared actions say. Do not improve the app, work around bugs, or try alternative "
    "routes to make a broken app look like it works -- the point is to find out whether it works.\n"
    "- If the app is broken, unresponsive, or missing what the declared actions need, choose 'done' and say so in "
    "your reasoning rather than hunting for a workaround.\n"
    "- After typing into a field you usually need a separate action to submit it (press Enter, or "
    "click the button).\n"
    "- To EDIT text an element already shows (a heading, a label, a cell), use 'input' on that "
    "element even when its role is not 'textbox': many apps make text editable in place, and no "
    "input element ever appears. Commit with Enter. Success shows as the element's text having "
    "changed, not as an edit control appearing.\n"
    "- Every action reports what the page did with it. 'nothing happened' means the page did not "
    "react at all: never repeat that action, take the next plausible gesture instead (for an edit, "
    "'input' into the element, then Enter). 'the page reacted but shows nothing new' means the "
    "control acknowledged the gesture without a visible result -- a highlight, an armed state -- "
    "and repeating it once may be exactly what that control wants.\n"
    "- 'scroll' is the exception: it moves the viewport, which the page state cannot show, so it "
    "reports 'nothing happened' even when it worked. Repeat it to reach further down the page.\n"
    "- More generally, where the history shows an action whose effect did not match what you "
    "expected of it, take that as the page telling you how it really works, and act on the "
    "corrected understanding rather than repeating the action.\n"
    "- If the page shows a pending state -- a spinner, 'loading', 'saving', a disabled control that "
    "should be enabled -- choose 'wait' and act on what the page shows afterwards. Do not act on "
    "content that is still arriving.\n"
    "- Choose 'reload' only where the declared actions say to reload. A reload the flow did not ask "
    "for is a last resort for an app that has visibly stopped responding after waiting, and it "
    "is recorded as such: an app that needs a reload to show its own state has already failed.\n"
