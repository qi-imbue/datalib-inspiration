two: the frontend's endpoint URLs are hand-written TypeScript, with no generated client, so a
harbor upgrade that renames a route would surface as a blank page rather than as a build failure.
These tests read the URLs straight out of the vendored source and check them against the routes
harbor actually registers."""
