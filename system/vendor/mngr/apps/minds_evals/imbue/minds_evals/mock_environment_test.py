    A workspace boots with no chat: the agents listing carries only ``system-services`` until a

    ``WELCOME_EXCHANGE`` has been delivered -- the workspace types `/welcome` in only once the agent
    is up, so ``welcome_delay_polls`` polls of the events endpoint see a chat that is WAITING and
    carries no messages at all. Each POST to ``/message`` appends that turn's
    ``turn_reply_events``, so the incremental events poll sees a new reply only after the send.

    A chat binds to a provider account at creation and only the sign-in endpoint mints one, so a
    create issued before sign-in is refused for want of an account -- the product behaviour that
    makes the driver's ordering load-bearing.

    ``box_lost_after_turn`` makes the box go away the moment that turn's events have been read:
    the workspace said something, the reader took it, and then the sandbox holding all of it
    vanished before the turn could finish. Every later command raises rather than answering, which
    is the difference between a box the host has lost and a workspace that merely refuses.
