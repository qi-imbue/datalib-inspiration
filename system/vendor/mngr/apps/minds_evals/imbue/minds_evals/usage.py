"""Token and cost accounting for a trial, split by who spent it.

Two different LLM consumers run during a trial and they must not be conflated:

- the **workspace agent** under test, whose consumption is the eval's subject. Its per-message usage
  already rides the workspace event stream: the workspace's chat app parses claude's session
  files itself (its claude session parser, behind ``AgentSessionWatcher``, reimplements mngr's
  common_transcript conversion) and attaches a ``usage`` block and a ``model`` to every
  ``assistant_message``. So nothing has to be collected out of the workspace before it is
  destroyed -- the driver's own transcript is an account that is always available. Under
  ``--ak proxy=true`` the in-box proxy's per-request log is a second account, and
  ``resolve_workspace_usage`` decides which one a trial reports. Two record vintages arrive on the
  transcript stream and both are read: the watcher's ``assistant_message`` records, and the
  ATIF-shaped ``step`` records (``source: "agent"``, token counts under ATIF's ``metrics`` names)
  that mngr's own emitters write. The one reconciliation that matters is the input bucket -- see
  ``_atif_token_snapshot``.
- the **decider**, the harness's simulated-user model. It is a cost of running the eval, not a
  property of the thing being measured, so it is reported separately as metadata.

**What the transcript does not see: delegated work.** The events endpoint serves main-session events
only -- a subagent's turns are deliberately routed to a separate per-subagent stream so they do not
render inline in the parent thread -- and work handed to a freshly created mngr worker agent belongs
to that agent's stream entirely. An agent that delegates would therefore look cheaper than one that
does the same work inline, which would make cost gameable. The evidence phase captures the stream of
every worker the chat agent launched, and ``resolve_workspace_usage`` sums those streams into the
transcript account (``combine_trial_usages``); subagent turns and workers whose stream was not
captured are what that account still cannot see. The proxy is the account that includes all of it,
because every call in the workspace crosses it. Either way delegation is at least *detected*: a trial
with a subagent call or an uncaptured worker is marked ``is_cost_complete = False`` rather than
quietly reporting a clean total.

Both are priced with ``mngr_usage``'s table rather than a local copy, so these numbers and the
in-box proxy's own are computed from one set of rates -- ``proxy_config`` builds the proxy's config
from the same table. Those rates are pinned to litellm's map by ``litellm_pricing_test``, which
covers the four flat per-token buckets; the fast-mode multiplier applied on top of them is
``mngr_usage``'s own ``FAST_MODE_PRICE_MULTIPLIER``, pinned by ``pricing_test``.

**Speed tier and what it does to cost.** Fast mode bills the same tokens at twice the standard rate
($10/$50 per MTok against $5/$25 on Opus 5 and Opus 4.8), and it is chosen per request, so a model id
alone does not determine a price. Token counts are unaffected; only the rate applied to them is. The
proxy records the tier per request and each tier's tokens are then priced at its own rate, so a trial
that ran fast reports what it actually cost. A source that cannot see the tier -- the transcript --
prices everything standard and says so through ``is_cost_rate_certain``: that figure is a floor, and
half the truth if the workspace was in fast mode, which by default it is.

Token buckets follow ``TokenSnapshot``'s non-overlapping convention: ``input`` counts only
non-cached input, with cache reads and cache writes kept separate, because Anthropic prices the
three differently (a cache write costs 1.25x a plain input token, a cache read 0.1x). Collapsing
them into one "input" number cannot produce a correct cost, and hides the cache behaviour that
cache-aware compaction work needs to see.
