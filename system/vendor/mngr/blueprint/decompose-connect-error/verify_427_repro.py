"""Synthetic #427: a key path with no known_hosts sibling, driven end to end.

Not a test -- a manual-verification script, kept next to the plan whose
acceptance criteria it satisfies. It is here rather than in the suite because it
spans four layers the suite deliberately tests apart, and because rendering the
card shells out to the frontend toolchain, which CI does not have wired up for
Python tests.

What it drives, in one pass, against real components rather than doubles:

1. the real ``mngr forward`` FastAPI app, against a resolver holding SSH info
   whose key has no known_hosts anywhere near it -- exactly issue #427's shape;
2. the envelope it emits, through minds' real consumer parsing;
3. minds' real ``BackendFailureRecorder`` policy and health tracker;
4. the real ``/ui/api/workspaces/<id>/recovery-info`` route over Flask;
5. the real ``RecoveryCardBody`` component, rendered from that route's payload;
6. and the clear-on-recovery edge, from both the verdict and the route.

Run it with ``uv run python blueprint/decompose-connect-error/verify_427_repro.py``
from the repo root. It needs ``pnpm install`` to have been run in
``apps/minds/frontend`` for step 6 -- that directory is pnpm-managed, and running
``npm install`` in it writes back the npm lockfile the repo ignores.
