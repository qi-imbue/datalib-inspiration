# Open threads on the workspace-update work

The one tracker for what is still open across the combined update branch
(`gabriel/tactful-swift`: mngr-internal PR #639 + the paired
default-workspace-template PR #501). It covers both halves: the Minds-app side
(detection, badges, modal, dispatch, scheduling, the apply window) and the
template side (the atomic `apply`/`recover`, the marker, the staleness banner,
the unattended pass). The template repo's `docs/system/blueprint/safe-update-apply/`
holds only that side's spec and points here for anything unresolved.

Resolved items are dropped rather than struck through; the decisions worth
remembering are in the last two sections. Claims about the code were checked
against both branches on 2026-08-28, and 1g was added on 2026-09-10 from
workspaces created from published templates. 1g's fix was then built on
2026-09-11; it stays in §1 because two pieces of it are still open -- the
create-time label, and the publish-side tag push that would retire the fetch
for later-published templates -- and the entry says which part is which.

Some items carry a transcript pointer for the conversation that raised them,
relative to two Claude Code project directories on the author's machine:

## 1. Follow-ups that are decided but not built

### 1a. Reconcile the host env file from an update (needs mngr + minds work)

From the geebspace regression (Sentry `a48711fe73aa415a81256cb337def87d`,
minds 0.4.2): `minds-v0.3.12` retired the secondary latchkey gateway, so the
desktop app stopped creating the port-1990 tunnel, but the workspace's host env
file, written once at `mngr create`, still named it. A user app read
`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_SECONDARY` with no fallback and served stale data for eight
days. Every gate the branch adds would still pass on that update.

Why it is the update flow's problem: `_write_host_env_vars`
(`libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/create.py`) is called only from host creation; the
values are `--host-env` flags the desktop app builds from
`prepare_agent_latchkey`'s `latchkey_env` (`agent_creator.py`), so nothing in
the template's tree names them and update-self cannot see them. A workspace's
latchkey env is therefore whatever its creation-time flags said, for as long as
the workspace lives. `Host.set_env_vars` exists on both ends; what does not
exist is a caller.

Decided shape: the updating agent asks the app to reconcile it, over the
latchkey gateway's `minds-api-proxy` that `update-self` already uses for
`GET /api/v1/app/version` (whose baseline grant exists for exactly the
unattended-worker case). Pieces:

1. A mngr CLI surface for host env on an existing host (a thin wrapper over
   `Host.set_env_vars`; `--host-env` exists only on `mngr create` today).
2. `GET /api/v1/workspaces/<agent_id>/host-env/check` first: returns the
   added / removed / changed key names without applying, so the worker can grep
   the workspace for each (this alone would have caught the regression).
   Degrade, don't fail, on an old app (record the gap in the report and
   continue; `/app/version` treats 403/404 as "predates the route"). Return
   names only: `LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` and the override JWT are credentials.
3. `POST .../host-env/reconcile`, driven via `_run_mngr_blocking`, returning the
   diff applied. Defensible ungated because it is self-targeting and
   payload-free: the only reachable outcome is "match what a fresh create would
   produce today". It belongs before the apply's services-agent restart, since
   the env file is read only at process launch.
4. One permission entry (`workspace_permissions.json`, or a baseline grant on
   the `app/version` model) and the call from the worker with `$MNGR_AGENT_ID`.

Constraints: `prepare_agent_latchkey` is not idempotent (it mints a fresh
permissions handle and, for desktop-gateway hosts, a new override JWT; only
`LATCHKEY_GATEWAY_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE` mints, the rest is deterministic), so
factor the pure part out. Drift is bidirectional: geebspace's env was also
*missing* `MINDS_VIA_DESKTOP_URL_PREFIX`, so removal-only is not enough.

Open decision: which keys mngr owns. `agent_setup.py` names only the current
constants, so "keys I no longer emit" cannot be computed from current code.
Prefix ownership (mngr owns `LATCHKEY_*` in the host env file and replaces that
subset each provision; verify first that nothing else writes a `LATCHKEY_*`
host-env key) looks right, with an explicit retired-keys list carrying a
`CLEANUP:` marker per entry as the fallback.

### 1b. A post-apply pass over the live workspace (template)

Every gate runs pre-apply and off-live: §4b validates in the worker's worktree,
and the apply's own gates are `_preflight` (the merged backend on a throwaway
port) and the frontend probe. Nothing probes the user's own apps against the
live workspace after the apply, which is where the geebspace regression lived
(a live host env var, not a file). A verdict of `UPDATED` is about the merge; a
user app the update quietly broke does not enter it, and the refresh pipeline
keeping its last good copy on failure makes a dead integration look like
"nothing changed".

Decided: the pass must not add to the user's wait, so it is a background step
after the verdict is recorded that upgrades an `UPDATED` verdict (or appends to
its detail) when it finds soft failures. The cheap version is the widened
`check-app-errors` skill (already on the branch: every log including stdout,
lowercase soft-failure prose, recently-changed logs, scheduled jobs reconciled
against their logs). Build it once that widened check has been exercised on a
real update.

### 1c. Dedupe the staleness detector's copies (template, SI side)

The decision against splitting `update_self.py` into a `system/libs` package
stands (see §3). What survives of that finding is SI-side only:
`update_staleness.py` carries a narrower copy of `classify_path` because it
cannot import from the skill, and the marker path is a literal in
`update_staleness.py`, `bootstrap/manager.py`, and
`update_apply_contract.py`. Dedupe in the SI's direction, without the skill
importing anything.

### 1d. `strict=False` covers only the in-process read (needs a mngr PR)

Only `agent_discovery.py`'s `load_config` call is relaxed. `mngr
start/stop/create/destroy` subprocesses still parse settings strictly, so the
update-time lockout persists for those. No such change is on this branch.

### 1g. Workspaces created from a published template never get a readable version (minds + template)

Built app-side on 2026-09-11, folded into the existing version read
(`workspace_version.py`): when both of the read's sources come up empty, the
same one-shot shell command ensures minds' `official` remote, fetches
`refs/tags/minds-v*` from the official template under a time limit, and
describes again. The rest of this entry is the state that led there, why this
side of it, and what it does not cover.

A workspace created from a published template (the `/create/template?git_url=`
deeplink, formerly "inspirations") on imbue_cloud badged "Version unknown" and
stayed that way; one created locally is stamped with the app's own pin and reads
up to date, which is the same gap wearing a different label. `_detect_one`
(`workspace_update_state.py`) reads git first, then the create-time label, and
`derive_update_detection` reports `NO_MACHINE_VERSION` for anything that does
not parse as `minds-v*`. Neither source names the template's real base:

- **Git** (`workspace_version.py`): the newest `update-self:` marker, else `git
  describe --tags --match 'minds-v*'`. A published template is the base's
  history plus one snapshot commit parented on `BASE_REF` (publish-template
  §8), pushed as `<sha>:refs/heads/main` with no tags; the publishing mind's
  own history, markers included, never leaves. The clone has neither.
- **Label**: the create route stamps `original_minds_version=(branch_or_tag or
  branch or FALLBACK_BRANCH)` (`api_v1.py`), and the deeplink leaves `branch`
  blank. For imbue_cloud, `resolve_template_version` runs `git ls-remote
  --tags` on the template repo, whose `v\d+\.\d+\.\d+` pattern matches nothing
  there, and falls back to `"main"`: the label is `main`. For docker/lima the
  label is `FALLBACK_BRANCH`, the app's own pin, whatever base the template was
  cut from: a false positive that reads up to date rather than unknown. A link
  carrying `&branch=main` gives `main` on every mode.

Why neither cleared on its own: a workspace gets a `minds-v*` tag only when
something fetches tags into it, and until this change nothing in a
template-derived workspace's life did. An `update-self` run does (its §2 `git
fetch upstream --tags` lands the tags, and the landing commit names one), and
so does the backup check script, which fetches `--tags` from its own `official`
remote when the minimum backup tag is missing locally -- but that runs from the
per-workspace backups route, only for a workspace with backups enabled.
Bootstrap touches neither remote. Meanwhile an UNKNOWN row is never offered
(`is_update_offered`), is excluded from "update all" (`updatableAgentIds`), and
is not scheduled by the app, so the only exit was the user pressing update on a
row that says it cannot tell; the local row is not offered one either, because
it reads current.

The base is knowable: the snapshot sits on the mind's `Initial workspace
commit`, whose parent is the tagged base commit, so `git describe` answers the
moment the base's tags are in the clone (publish-template §8 step 4 relies on
exactly that), and `system/config/parent.toml` in the published tree still
names default-workspace-template. So the fetch is all that was missing.

Why the app side, over the two other places it could have gone: fetching the
base's tags from bootstrap (`git fetch upstream --tags` against `parent.toml`'s
remote), or pushing the `minds-v*` tags with `main` from publish-template (or
recording the base tag in `template.toml` or the snapshot subject, which today
names `BASE_REF` as a sha), both only reach workspaces created from templates
published after the change. The version read reaches every workspace the app
can exec into, the ones already out there included, and because git outranks
the create-time label it also corrects the local path's false "up to date".
It reuses the `official` remote and URL the backup scripts already own
(`OFFICIAL_REMOTE_URL`), deliberately ignoring `parent.toml`, so a workspace
published from a private clone still describes against the official releases,
and it leaves the `upstream` name to update-self.

Three costs, accepted. A workspace that stays tagless -- no marker, no
reachable tag -- re-runs the fetch on every 300s detection sweep, because only
a successful read is cached and the sweep keeps no failure memory (no backoff
was built). The first read writes the `official` remote into the workspace's
git config, the same write the backup scripts already make, and the objects it
fetches are inside the backup root, so a workspace with backups on stores them
too (once: restic deduplicates, and `_DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDES` has no `.git`
entry to drop them, nor should it -- the history is the point of backing a
workspace up). And the fetch is
not small: the refspec takes every `minds-v*` tag, including releases newer
than the workspace's base, whose commits the clone does not hold. Measured
against the real template: **17 MB** (1.7s on a fast link) into a clone
published from `minds-v0.5.0`, and **70 MB** into a repo that shares no history
with the template at all. A read-only `git ls-remote --tags` plus a local `git
tag` per already-present commit would cost 3 KB, at the price of shell that
picks the nearest tag itself; the fetch was kept because it reuses the remote
and the `describe` already there.

Those numbers bought two guards, because the 70 MB case is not the one this
fixes. The fetch runs only when `parent.toml` is in the tree (`system/config/`
since minds-v0.3.10, the repo root before that) -- the template's own record of
where the tree came from, which a published template keeps, and which a
workspace created from a user's own repo does not have. Without it such a
workspace paid the 70 MB and `describe` still answered nothing. The fetch is
also skipped in a *shallow* clone, where the tags land but `describe` cannot
relate them to HEAD, measured; real workspaces are cloned non-shallow on
purpose (`agent_creator.py` says why: a shallow source breaks the mirror push
into the container), so this guard is about trees like the snapshot e2e's
`--depth 1` template materialization rather than anything a user has.

The fetch's own ceiling is 120s inside a 150s exec for the version read (the
history read keeps 30s): a read killed mid-fetch keeps none of the transfer, so
a ceiling too small for it turns the one-time cost into one paid every sweep,
and both bounds stay under the sweep's 300s interval so a read can never
overlap its own next pass and have two fetches writing one workspace's refs.

Still open, and narrower: the create-time label itself stays dishonest.
`resolve_template_version` reports `main` for a template repo with no semver
tags, and a non-default `git_url` is still stamped with `FALLBACK_BRANCH` on
docker/lima. It shows through wherever the git read cannot answer: a workspace
the app cannot exec into, and now also one the guards skip, where a user's own
repo reads as the app's own pin rather than as unknown.

Also still worth doing, for a different reason than when it was a candidate:
push the `minds-v*` tags alongside `main` in publish-template (§8). It cannot
help any workspace that exists today, which is why the app side was built
first, but every template published after it would read its version with no
remote, no fetch and no network from inside the workspace -- retiring this code
path for everything published from then on, rather than duplicating it.

## 2. Product and verification threads

- **Two adjacent settings sections named "Updates" and "Machine updates"**
  (`SettingsSections.ts`: the app's own auto-updater vs. the workspace night
  window). A rename was suggested as a product call.
  > `$APPUX/a61b083d-39d9-48b7-b734-a569133ca865.jsonl`, agent
  > `tsk_01m0tcb2gwexrs46dzjkj2fwdx`, `2026-08-24T17:29:51Z`, last paragraph.
- **A "Cancel update" for a run in flight**, deferred 2026-08-26. The modal
  cancels a *schedule*; nothing cancels a run. Wanted: a press mid-run that
  destroys the run's chat agent and puts the row back to IDLE explicitly, so
  the next poll does not file STALLED and show "Update failed". Open points:
  STARTING has no agent yet, so a cancel there is a flag the dispatch checks
  after its spawn returns; APPLYING should refuse; destroy takes the chat's
  transcript with it.
- **Repeated silent skips of "Update tonight".** Modeled on iOS: an
  unreachable machine or one with agents working is skipped and re-armed, and
  the modal shows the last skip reason. Undecided whether repeated skips should
  eventually escalate beyond that line.
  > `$APPUX/07744cac-c50b-40a9-8692-4e6cb0c85c67.jsonl`, agent
  > `tsk_01kzyqrz1bev88st4cbf97sjqz`, `2026-08-14T17:30:45Z`, item 3.
- **The modal's version list with dates.** Shipped link-only; a release CI
  step that synthesizes a changelog was floated and never specced.
- **A badge-opened update modal is not mutually exclusive with the recovery
  card.** An auto-raised recovery card is; a modal the user opened by hand is
  not.
  > `$APPUX/54894249-3893-456b-8cd1-137a1364c5a0.jsonl`, agent
  > `tsk_01m0ttrt4mf51rzy0wy9vq8zd0`, `2026-08-24T21:59:56Z`.
- **The auto-open tab race is narrowed, not closed.** For a stopped machine the
  backend (probe + create) and the frontend (poll + page load + WS connect) are
  both waiting on the same host; nothing guarantees the frontend wins, and
  neither side has been measured. The deterministic alternative (an explicit
  `layout.py open` from the app) was ruled out as unacceptable coupling.
  > `$APPUX/dcfb5a48-8b7a-4fc4-8abe-c9126268c6e0.jsonl`, agent
  > `tsk_01m0wxtc0jez1rwwphb92mz4eb`, `2026-08-25T18:51:12Z`; the ruling is in
  > `$APPUX/f862ce3b-fb02-4347-bb43-c65161dced86.jsonl` at `19:05:14Z`.
- **No manual Electron verification of the newest UI work**: the liveness-poll
  badges ("Preparing update…", "Updating…", "Waiting for you") and the
  version-override settings group.
- **The customization-survival hold** (intact / intact-but-changed /
  cannot-be-kept; only the third holds) has not been through real updates. If
  holds prove too frequent or too rare, the lever is the worker guide's
  adapt-first wording.
- From the safe-update-apply spec: whether the boot log is enough of a fallback
  when the DRI wake fails post-recovery (the snapshots should have restored
  `mngr`); and whether the staleness banner needs any affordance beyond text
  without becoming an action surface.

---

## 3. Decisions worth remembering

- **One channel, `run.json`.** The app reads a single file
  (`data/.state/update-apply/run.json`, written by `update_self.py run-status`)
  in the same exec that lists the run's chat agent. The event stream, the
  `update=true` label, the `update` source in mngr_forward, and the consent
  tiers (`UpdateConsentKind`, the 428 handshake) were all deleted. The apply
  mirrors its marker phase and restamp into the record, so the app never reads
  the marker; the apply window is sized off that restamp plus the template's
  recovery grace, with the fixed 360s only as a fallback for an unreadable
  restamp.
- **No `system/libs/update_apply` split.** The skill's first step stages the
  *target* version's copy of itself and runs from it, so the apply must stay
  self-contained: an import would resolve against the old tree, or no tree
  during recovery. The test reaches the module by path ~217 times, and a split
  adds an import-resolution failure surface to the one program that must work
  when the tree is broken.
- **Whole-merge revert on any apply failure is retained** despite Incident A's
  blast radius; the half-applied alternative is worse. The one exception: a
  failed provisioner run alone does not roll back (the tree and services stay
  consistent, the re-run is cheap); the apply continues to the restart and
  probes and, if they pass, lands with `provision-incomplete.json` and a loud
  stderr line, exit code still 0.
- **A stale or unstamped `--worker-bundle` falls back to a live build** rather
  than failing the apply: failing would turn a passable apply into a
  whole-release rollback whose retry needs a fresh worker pass, and
  update-system-interface's ordinary merge makes the worker's bundle
  legitimately stale. A *live* build that does not match the merged tree does
  fail before restart.
- **Every apply restarts the services agent**; the per-path restart rule was a
  list nobody could keep complete.
- **A machine below `minds-v0.3.10` is badged "Recreate to update" up front**;
  the app carries no migration machinery, and every short-ending verdict is one
  "Update failed" outcome pointing at the agent's chat.
- **Scheduling an UNKNOWN machine for tonight** means an unattended run may
  land a merge from an upstream Minds cannot name; full parity was chosen over
  attended-only. The one place the design widens what runs unwatched.
- **Prerelease tags** are ordered by the parser but none exist (the
  release-channel manifest rejects them); revisit when the canary channel's tag
  shape is decided.
- **The bug-report collector** now attaches every agent's transcript written
  inside the recency window, workers included, so a successful pass `mngr
  stop`s its worker rather than destroying it.

---

## 4. Incident background

The template side was shaped by three real updates; the flow-level fixes are
all on the branch and described in the `.agents` changelog entry.

- **Incident A** (a minds workspace updating to minds-v0.4.1 under the old
  flow): the reveal silently failed, its `--rollback-to` reverted the entire
  2,527-file update, a retry reported "nothing to reveal" over the reverted
  tree, and the user had a broken chat interface for ~55 minutes while the
  agent claimed success twice. Source of: the atomic apply, the exit-code
  contract, `_has_rollback_since`, the ledger written post-success only, the
  `strict=False` read, the staleness banner, per-phase timings and budgets.
- **Incident B** (Sentry `4cf0919b9dc74b8f98ef9bc049e9bb66`, geebspace): a
  live re-provision hit the Claude installer following `HOME=/home/user` while
  the check read `/root/.local/bin/claude`, and `bunzip2 -c >
  /usr/local/bin/restic` truncating a binary `host_backup` was executing
  (ETXTBSY). Source of: `HOME=/root` in `setup_system.sh`, the
  decompress-then-rename install, the provisioner's canonical env, the
  provisioner-failure-does-not-roll-back rule, the live re-provision test in
  `apps/minds/test_snapshot_resume.py`, `norecursedirs = ["data"]`, and the
  `classify-merge` degenerate-base refusal.
- **The geebspace regression** (§1a above): a retired env var nobody grepped
  for. Source of: `with_agent_env.sh` exporting the full system PATH (its
  `/root/.local/bin:$PATH` had hidden `/usr/local/bin/latchkey` from every
  cron job: 256,654 failures and zero successful runs since 2026-08-03), the
  worker's impact analysis enumerating `system/vendor/**` and the vendored
  changelogs, and the widened `check-app-errors`.
