"""Surfacing the tab of a chat created from outside the workspace, once, where the user is.

A chat the Minds app starts -- the update run behind "Update now", the help chat behind "Ask
an agent" -- carries a label asking for its tab to be opened when it appears. The app cannot
dock a tab itself: it is outside the workspace, and the user may not be looking yet. So the
chat app reacts to the label on a newly observed agent and asks the shell to open the chat's
address in every connected client, which files it into whatever view each client is on.

A chat is owed its tab exactly once. Delivery is remembered on disk, so a restart of this app
(the update run itself restarts it) neither re-pops a tab the user has since closed nor loses
one nobody was there to take: with no client connected the open is held and retried until a
client connects, for as long as the chat exists. Only a chat the ledger already names is left
to the saved layout -- along with the chats a workspace already had the first time this app
kept a ledger at all, which are adopted as shown rather than each popping a tab.
