"""End-to-end tests for a chat panel opened during agent creation.

``create-chat`` returns 201 as soon as the background ``mngr create`` thread
starts, but the agent is only registered with the ``AgentManager`` when that
thread finishes. Every endpoint the freshly opened panel calls resolves the
agent through that registry, so the panel's first ``/events`` fetch 404s and
latches into the "No conversation data" view.

The ``provisional_chat_created`` broadcast normally covers that window with the
"Starting the chat" page, but it is a transient edge event: the frontend holds
the provisional chat only between ``provisional_chat_created`` and
``provisional_chat_completed``, so any delivery lag longer than the creation itself
leaves no render in which the cover is up. These tests pin the two ways that
happens -- the event missing the window entirely, and the pair arriving
back-to-back -- and assert the panel recovers on its own once the agent
resolves, with no reload and no tab switch.
