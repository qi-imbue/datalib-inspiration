"""Re-tag chat agents' memory-shedding priority from live workspace activity.

The launch wrapper tags every agent's ``oom_score_adj`` once at startup (see
``system/services/oom_priority``). This engine keeps *chat* agents' scores current: a chat
the user is engaged with is protected from an out-of-memory shed, and a chat left
untouched long enough climbs past the worker band so a stale chat is shed before
the worker a live chat just spawned.

Signals, and where each comes from:

- **open** / **visible** -- the chat page's presence in each client, reported by
  the page itself through the chat app's presence route and aggregated by the
  ``PresenceTracker`` (open while any client's report is unexpired, visible
  while any client's last report says so),
- **messaged** -- a message sent through the chat app's send route; drives a
  recency ranking across all chats, newest-first,
- **running** -- the chat's mngr lifecycle state, pushed in from the observe
  stream via ``record_running_chats``. Entering a running state counts as
  engagement (it is the only evidence of a message sent outside the UI -- by
  ``mngr message`` or by another agent), and staying in one marks the chat
  mid-turn, which suspends its staleness climb until the turn ends.

Idle time is measured against the most recent of those events, wall-clock, with
the agent's own process-start time as a floor so a freshly revived chat counts as
fresh. Across a system-interface restart the message stamps are re-seeded from
the durable client-activity log (``seed_last_message_times``), so a restart does
not hand every chat a fresh grace period.

Only chats are managed. Workers and the primary (services) agent are
excluded by the caller's ``list_chat_ids`` (they keep their launch bands --
workers stay maximally expendable, the primary stays pinned), so opening,
switching to, or messaging one of them never moves its score. A chat with no live
process (dormant, revives on its next message) is simply skipped until its
process exists.

Re-tagging is event-driven plus a slow sweep. The events (presence reports,
sends, and lifecycle changes) cover everything that *raises* a chat's
protection; the sweep exists because staleness is the one signal that changes
with no event to announce it -- a chat crosses a ramp threshold simply by sitting
there. The messaged-revive path is race-free without the sweep: the send blocks
until the revived process is ready (and the launch wrapper registers its pid
before that), and the send route records the message only after the send
returns, so ``reapply``'s pid lookup finds the live process.

The band arithmetic lives in ``oom_priority.bands`` (the stdlib-only, testable
policy); this engine only holds the activity state and drives the writes. All
collaborators are injected so the engine is unit-testable without ``/proc``, the
agent manager, or the pid registry.
