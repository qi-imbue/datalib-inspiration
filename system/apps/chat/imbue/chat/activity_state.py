"""Shared primitives for per-agent activity state surfaced on the chat panel.

Holds the common building blocks the harness trackers use: the ``ActivityState``
enum, the ``is_non_turn_tail_event`` reader (the fold's tail-type gate), the
timestamp parser, and the ``is_transcript_tail_stale`` restart guard. The actual
IDLE / THINKING / TOOL_RUNNING *derivation* lives in the two harness peers --
:mod:`claude_activity_state` (lifecycle + transcript tail) and
:mod:`codex_activity_state` (the ``task_started`` / ``task_complete`` turn latch) --
and the harness dispatch is in ``agent_manager._recompute_activity_state``.

The ``*_process_started`` marker (touched by mngr on every startup/resume) is the
boundary the stale-tail guard compares against: a transcript tail older than the
current process is left over from a turn this process never ran and must not show
"Thinking..." indefinitely after a mid-turn restart.
