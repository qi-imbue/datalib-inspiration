    A document is assembled per request (base path, hostname, agent ids, and the

    between a reload and a stale UI: the built assets it links are
    content-hashed, so a freshly-fetched document always names the current
    bundle, and a cached one always names the old one.

    That matters because a page cannot drop its own HTTP cache -- the
    ``location.reload(true)`` form is a Firefox-only extension -- so
    ``reloadInterface`` (the shell frontend's ``reload.ts``) can only reload and
    trust the response to be fresh. ``no-store`` is what makes that trust
    well-founded, including for viewers reaching the workspace through a
