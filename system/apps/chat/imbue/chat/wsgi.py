    ``flask_sock`` builds one ``simple_websocket.Server`` per connection from
    ``SOCK_SERVER_OPTIONS`` and completes the WebSocket handshake (selecting and
    echoing the subprotocol) *before* our route handler runs, so a handler cannot
    choose the subprotocol per-connection. ``simple_websocket``'s default
    ``choose_subprotocol`` echoes the first client-offered subprotocol that is
    ``in`` this allow-list; making ``__contains__`` always true turns that into a
    transparent passthrough -- the server echoes back whatever subprotocol the
    client requested.

    Chrome aborts a WebSocket handshake (close 1006) if the client offered a
    subprotocol and the 101 response echoes none, so any future WS route that
    negotiates a subprotocol works without touching this list. Today's own
    endpoint (the ``/api/ws`` broadcaster) offers no subprotocol, so the
    negotiation loop never runs and no subprotocol is echoed -- the passthrough
    is inert for it but keeps the server permissive for subprotocol-bearing
