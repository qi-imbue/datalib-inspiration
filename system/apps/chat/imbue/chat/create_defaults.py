"""The `mngr create` defaults the workspace keeps for its default provider account.

Every `mngr create` in the workspace that names no harness and no account -- the chats the
Minds app starts from outside, workers, automations, the caretaker -- resolves through
`.mngr/settings.local.toml`, mngr's git-ignored local config layer, which sits above the
committed `.mngr/settings.toml` and below the CLI. Its managed `[commands.create]` keys name
the default account's harness as `type`, its binding (the variable claude is scoped by, or
for the other harnesses the credential symlink over `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR`, which needs no
agent id), and the `account=<id>` label a re-auth restarts agents by.

The account store owns the file: it is rewritten from the index on every index write and at
the chat app's boot, and is derived output only -- the pin and the most recently used account
stay in `index.json`. The list keys use mngr's `__extend` operator so the local layer only
ever adds to what the committed file sets; a CLI flag for the same key appends after both, so
an explicit `--type` or `--env` still wins. Keys outside the managed ones survive a rewrite.
