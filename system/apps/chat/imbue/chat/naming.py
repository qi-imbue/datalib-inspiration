"""How the workspace's objects get their names.

The naming scheme mirrors how the minds app names hosts: every object wears a
human-readable display name ("Chat 2"), and its true name -- the identifier
embedded in tmux sessions, paths, and refs -- is a deterministic canonical form
of that display name ("Chat-2"). The pair is established at create time and
kept matched on rename, so no surface ever shows a machine-minted coolname.

For chat agents the display name lives on the mngr agent itself, as its
``display_name`` label, with the canonical form as the agent's mngr name.
Display names are minted here, server-side, as the first free "<word> N" for
the harness's word ("Chat 1", "Codex 2", ...), so two clients creating at the
same time cannot both mint "Chat 1".
