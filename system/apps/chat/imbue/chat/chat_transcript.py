"""A chat's transcript as the read routes see it: the segments of its agents, in order.

A chat is a sequence of agent transcripts (``docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/``).
The read routes (``/api/chats/<chat_id>/events`` and the event detail) read through this
facade rather than through one agent's watcher, so the routes are written against the
chat's transcript now and the segment concatenation lands behind them later.

Today every chat has exactly one segment, its active agent's, so each read is that
segment's read.
