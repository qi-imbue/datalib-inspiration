"""Per-chat, per-client presence: which clients have a chat's page open, and whether it is showing.

The chat page reports its own presence to the chat app (contracts.md section 10):
``hidden`` once the shell has handed it its handshake,
``visible`` on ``shell:shown``, ``hidden`` again on ``shell:hidden``, ``closed`` on
``pagehide``, and a heartbeat of its current state every minute. Only the chat's own page
reports: a subagent view is a second page of the same chat in the same client, and one
standing report per chat and client is kept here, so its reports would overwrite the chat
page's. The OOM prioritizer reads the aggregate: a chat is *open* while any client has an
unexpired report, and *visible* while any client's last report says so. A report expires
after ten minutes, so a page that vanished without its ``pagehide`` (a crashed tab, a lost
laptop) stops counting on its own.
