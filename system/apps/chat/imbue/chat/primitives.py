A chat is the user-facing conversation (one tab, one instance key, one transcript); an agent is
one mngr agent running one harness on one account. A chat's id is the id of its first agent, so
the two strings are equal today and keep the same ``agent-<hex>`` shape, but they are distinct
types in code so the type checker finds every crossing between the two
