"""HTTP endpoints for the provider chooser: `/api/lanes` and `/api/accounts/*`.

Kept out of server.py for the same reason the claude-auth handlers are: the modal's logic
does not belong in the router.

The `AuthFlowService` holds the live PTY, so it is created once in `main.build_production_state` and
read back through `get_state()` here -- the subprocess has to survive between the POST that
starts a flow and the polls that advance it.
