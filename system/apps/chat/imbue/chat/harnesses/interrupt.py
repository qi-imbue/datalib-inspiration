"""Per-harness stop-button behavior: interrupt the running turn and hand the queued
messages back to the user's composer (Contract B).

HOW a turn is interrupted is per-harness. The default -- for claude and any future harness --
is the BASE restart-drain: capture the block, SIGKILL-relaunch the process, settle activity,
clear the mirror. A harness that can interrupt its live turn natively (pi here; codex and
claude in sibling plans) registers an override instead.

This mirrors the model-resolver precedent (:mod:`harnesses.model`): one abstract class, one
subclass per harness that needs it, registered on the :class:`~harnesses.registry.HarnessSpec`
and dispatched by ``AgentInfo.harness`` -- the endpoint never branches on the harness name. It
is backend-only: there is no wire-visible catalog flag, so the frontend keeps one button and
one endpoint, and an unregistered harness legitimately falls through to the base.

The endpoint binds the harness-neutral capabilities the implementation may need -- the queue
watcher, a process restart, an activity-settle, and the native cancel keypress -- exactly as
the switch endpoint binds its ``send`` callback. A native override that needs only some of them
(pi, codex) simply ignores the rest.
