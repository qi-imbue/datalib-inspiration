"""Unit tests for the shared tool-output rules.

The two tk rules live here rather than in any harness: every harness asks the same two
questions of a command it has already located, so the answers must not be able to differ
between them. The resident error snippet is shared the same way, so its rule (and the
hook-block exception to it) is tested here too.
