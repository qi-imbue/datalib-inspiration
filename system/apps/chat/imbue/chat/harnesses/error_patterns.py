"""Classify a model API error out of an agent's failure text.

When a request to the model API fails, each harness writes the failure somewhere in its
transcript, in its own surface form:

* claude: a synthetic assistant message, ``API Error: 529 Overloaded``, sometimes carrying
  the raw error JSON.
* pi: an assistant message with empty ``content`` and the whole failure in a sibling
  ``errorMessage`` -- a bare ``"<status> <json>"``, e.g.
  ``400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error",...}}``.
* codex: a ``task_complete`` event carrying ``error.message``, usually alongside a structured
  ``codex_error_info`` its parser prefers over this.

The kind set and the provider-fault split are ordinary HTTP semantics, so they are
harness-agnostic; only the surface-form regexes differ, and both live below.

Auth-family failures are handled by :mod:`auth_errors`, which has its own recovery surface --
so they are deliberately NOT classified here. That is enforced rather than left to the tables:
:func:`classify_api_error` returns ``None`` for anything the auth vocabulary claims, so a
message can never carry both subtexts. Without it the two families overlap by construction --
Anthropic reports exhausted third-party usage as a 400 ``invalid_request_error``, which is in
BOTH this module's type table and the auth one. :func:`kind_for_status` is the exception: it
sees a status and no text, so it leaves that decision to its caller.

The kind set and the provider-fault split are ordinary HTTP semantics, so they
are harness-agnostic; only the two surface-form regexes are Claude-shaped. A
second harness that surfaces provider errors differently classifies them in its
own parser and stamps the same event fields (``is_api_error`` /
``api_error_kind`` / ``is_provider_fault``), which is the shared contract the
frontend reads.
