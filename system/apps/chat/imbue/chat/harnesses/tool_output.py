"""The structured facts stamped out of a tool result at parse time.

Tool outputs are not resident and never cross the wire (the payload-free event contract in
:mod:`harnesses.events`); whatever the default chat render needs from an output is lifted
out here, whole, while the parser still holds the raw text. Harness-neutral, shared by
every parser:

- **Latchkey permission requests.** An agent asks the user for permission by POSTing to
  the reserved ``latchkey-self.invalid/permission-requests`` host (see the latchkey
  skill); the gateway echoes the created request back on stdout as a JSON object. The
  mechanism is harness-agnostic -- the agent just runs curl -- so every parser detects the
  call from its input (:func:`is_permission_request_call` ->
  ``tool_call.display = "permission_request"``) and lifts the echoed object out of the
  result (:func:`find_permission_request` -> the event's ``permission_request`` field), so
  the card renders from structured data without fetching the output.

  Both readers assume one filing per tool call, with the echo in that call's own
  result. ``system/scripts/agent_latchkey_request_standalone.sh`` and its checker
  ``agent_latchkey_request_check.py`` are what hold the agent to it, on every harness;
  they exist for these two functions and copy ``PERMISSION_REQUEST_HOST`` from here, so
  changing what counts as a request call -- or how many a result can carry -- means
  revisiting that gate too.

- **tk step decoration.** tk lifecycle commands print machine-readable decoration on
  stdout (``Created <id>: <title>``, ``Updated <id> -> <status>``,
  ``tk-step <id> title|summary: ...``) that the chat progress view reads back from the
  transcript. :func:`tk_stamp` lifts exactly those lines (plus any line carrying a step-id
  token, which the historical input fallback's positional id-title zipping needs) into the
  resident ``tk_stamp`` field. The format is defined in ``system/vendor/tk/ticket``; keep
  the two in sync.

- **Error snippets.** A failed call must stay glanceable without a fetch, so
  :func:`error_snippet` keeps its first line resident -- except for a call a Claude Code hook
  refused, which gets no snippet (the workspace steering the agent is not a fault to flag).
