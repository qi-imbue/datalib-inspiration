"""A shared "watch these paths -> call this callback" utility.

The one "watch these paths, wake this loop" block shared by everything that tails
files: the model tracking (re-deriving an agent's choice whenever its live
``model_state.json`` changes) and every store-backed session watcher
(claude/codex/pi, via ``StoreBackedWatcher``). This wraps
the one shared primitive that already exists --
:class:`~imbue.chat.watcher_common.WakeOnChangeHandler` plus
``POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` -- into a small object that watches a set of paths and
invokes ``on_change`` on every real filesystem event (with the poll interval as a
safety net for missed events).

Per-path rule: an existing directory is watched recursively (so codex's rotating
rollout files under a stable sessions root all wake the loop without rescheduling);
anything else is watched via its parent directory (so a not-yet-created file --
claude's ``settings.json`` before first launch -- is caught the moment it appears).
Directories that do not exist yet are retried on each loop, mirroring the codex
watcher's lazy observer start.
