"""Tail a codex agent's live rollout and emit UI events.

Built on the shared :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.transcript_store` scaffolding
with a single lane: codex is one logical session to the UI, and the accumulated timeline
survives rollout rotation (a fresh file per session, and again on resume) because codex
re-serialises history into the new rollout with the same stable ids -- the store dedups the
copies and refreshes each event's source byte range to the newest serialisation, which is
exactly what the on-demand payload reads want.

We tail codex's LIVE rollout directly (the same real-time file codex writes), not the
stream_transcript.sh mirror -- the mirror lags codex by up to its 1s poll, long enough for
the "sending" bubble to visibly flip to "queued" before it reconciles. Which file is live
rotates, so we follow the ``codex_transcript_path`` marker (written by codex's
``UserPromptSubmit`` hook), falling back to the newest ``rollout-*.jsonl`` for web/CLI-only
agents whose hook never fires.

Codex-specific pieces kept here: the effective per-turn model read from ``turn_context``
lines and reflected into the model-bar state file, live suppression of ``user_message``
events (the subscribed ledger owns the live user-turn handoff -- the A3b chip-out-then-turn
ordering -- so the file reader must not broadcast a competing copy; the events stay in the
store for the read paths), and synthetic "Interrupted." results for tool calls a user
interrupt left open (codex never persists one, so the card would spin forever).
