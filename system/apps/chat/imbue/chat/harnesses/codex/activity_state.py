"""Codex's activity-state derivation -- the codex peer of :mod:`harnesses.claude.activity_state`.

Unlike claude, codex writes authoritative turn-boundary markers to its rollout in real time --
``task_started`` when a user turn begins, ``task_complete`` / ``turn_aborted`` when it ends (surfaced
by :mod:`harnesses.codex.session_parser` as ``turn_started`` / ``turn_completed`` / ``turn_aborted``
special events). So "the agent is working" is a simple latch on those, with **no reliance on the
(unreliable-for-codex, and polled-hence-laggy) mngr lifecycle**. Verified against real rollouts:
``task_started`` lands ~seconds before the first assistant text and ``task_complete`` just after the
last, so the dot stays lit across the whole turn and clears only once the text is on screen.

Within an open turn the transcript refines *what* the agent is doing: an in-flight tool call reads
TOOL_RUNNING, which the client renders as the tool's own verb ("Running", "Web search", ...) from the
labels each ``tool_call`` event already carries; plain reasoning reads THINKING.
