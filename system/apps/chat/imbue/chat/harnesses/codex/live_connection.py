"""One live app-server connection per codex agent -- the ledger's persistent home.

The message-lifecycle contract (see ``system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract.md``)
makes the backend the sole authority for a codex agent's five message states, and
:class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.codex.ledger.CodexMessageLedger` is that authority.
The ledger is a pure reducer over the stock ``codex app-server`` notification stream, so it needs
exactly one long-lived, thread-bound
:class:`~imbue.mngr_codex.app_server_client.CodexAppServerClient` feeding it. This class owns that
connection for one agent:

* it opens + handshakes + RESUMES the agent's root thread
  (:func:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.codex.model.open_subscribed_codex_client`) -- the
  ``thread/resume`` is what SUBSCRIBES the connection to the thread's ``turn/*`` / ``item/*``
  notifications, so the ledger hears delivery (``item/completed``) and reconcile
  (``turn/completed``); a ``bind_thread`` (the switch path) is local-only and would leave the
  ledger deaf to everything but ``thread/status/changed``. It then seeds the client's
  ``active_turn_id`` from the live ``thread/status`` (one ``thread/read``) so the very first send
  parks vs starts correctly and a mid-turn reconnect starts from the in-progress turn;
* it builds the ledger over that client with the manager's queue/activity/user-turn/model
  callbacks (``on_user_turn`` broadcasts each committed user-turn to the transcript stream -- the
  ledger owns live user-turns, the rollout file reader suppresses them, Fix 1);
* it runs a background reader thread that pumps ``poll_notifications`` into the ledger.

The send / interrupt / shoulder-tap endpoints reach the ledger synchronously (through the agent
manager) on their own request threads while the reader is polling; the client's frame lock
serializes the two, so the reader and a live send never steal each other's frames.

The connection is EPHEMERAL (contract): it lives with the agent's daemon generation. When the
daemon dies the reader observes a closed transport and marks the connection not-alive; the agent
manager reaps it and builds a fresh one on the next observe tick, whose ledger starts with an
empty queue -- nothing from the dead generation is revived.
