"""Codex's harness session: the one live app-server connection + message ledger.

Codex owns its message lifecycle natively in the daemon, so this session wraps
:class:`CodexLiveConnection` and answers every control-surface question off the ledger:
send, Sending state, tap availability, the tap itself, and the native turn interrupt.
The per-agent dynamic model option set (D2) lives here too -- seeded from the
connect-time ``model/list``, refreshed by each picker-open, persisted to the sidecar
for offline restarts.

Lock discipline: ``_lock`` guards only the connection build/close transitions (held
through the blocking connect, which serializes one agent's rebuilds); every reader takes
a lock-free atomic attribute read instead. That keeps ``is_tap_available`` safe to call
under the manager's own lock without any ordering between the two.
