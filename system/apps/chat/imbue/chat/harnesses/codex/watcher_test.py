"""Tests for the codex session watcher's read paths.

The regression these exist for: the read methods used to serve only what the background
thread had already parsed, so the first request after a system-interface restart could
answer "no transcript" for a rollout sitting on disk -- and the client caches that answer
and never refetches, leaving an empty chat until a page reload. Claude's watcher cannot
lose that race because its read paths re-read from disk on every call; these assert codex
now does the same, without the thread ever running.
