"""Codex's model catalog and its model resolver.

Codex drives the stock ``codex app-server``: a model/effort/fast change is
``thread/settings/update`` over the per-agent daemon, and the daemon echoes the
effective settings back on ``thread/settings/updated``. The live model chip is
kept uniform: the ledger (:mod:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.codex.ledger`)
mirrors each ``thread/settings/updated`` to the agent's
``model_state.json`` -- ``{"model", "effort", "fast"}``, the uniform
live-state schema -- and the shared reader
(:func:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.model.read_model_identity`) parses that
file via the harness's registered relative path (``plugin/codex/home``, i.e.
under CODEX_HOME). That is the event-driven replacement for the retired
``codex-in-minds`` fork's disk write; nothing else writes the file for codex.

This resolver owns only the WRITE (switch) side: it applies a selection via
``thread/settings/update`` on a short-lived per-switch connection to the daemon,
NOT by typing ``/model`` / ``/fast`` into the pane (the stock binary has no such
commands over the app-server drive). When no ``thread/settings/updated`` has been
mirrored yet the file is absent, the reader returns ``None``, and the bar shows
no slots at all.
