"""The codex message ledger -- the backend authority for a codex agent's message lifecycle.

The dumb frontend (contract A2) reads exactly one backend authority for a codex agent's
five message states; this is it. The ledger consumes the stock ``codex app-server``
notification stream (turn/*, item/*, thread/*) through the ONE persistent
:class:`~imbue.mngr_codex.app_server_client.CodexAppServerClient` and keeps every accepted
message in exactly one of the contract's states.

Identity (contract A4, Fix 2). The delivery/return decision keys on the app-server's own
``item.id`` -- the id codex assigns each committed ``userMessage`` -- which the ledger records
on the entry when the message commits. The minted ``client_id`` (``clientUserMessageId``) is NOT
the delivery key; it is only the correlation TOKEN that links our optimistic Sending/Queued entry
to the committed item, because codex assigns no ``item.id`` until commit (a parked steer has no
``item.id`` at all until the yield boundary consumes it -- verified live), so at send time the
token is the only handle we have. When the committed item arrives it echoes the token back, we
adopt its ``item.id``, and delivery is decided by that committed item (never by the ack).

Source-agnostic (contract A3, Fix 1/2). The subscribed ledger owns the LIVE user-turn: on any
``userMessage`` commit -- ours, a second client's, or one typed into the ``--remote`` TUI -- it
emits the user-turn to the transcript (via ``on_user_turn``), first removing the chip if the
message was one of our parked steers (the A3b ordered handoff: chip out, then turn in). The
rollout file reader suppresses live user-turns and re-emits them only on hydration; the two agree
on the user-turn ``event_id`` (keyed on the echoed ``client_id``, else the commit epoch-ms +
content) so the same message never double-shows. A FOREIGN commit (no token of ours) is emitted
as a live user-turn but is NOT one of our tracked entries: it never creates, removes, or returns a
chip, and does not count toward our five-state conservation (it was never accepted through our UI).

Our own accepted messages are each in exactly one of the contract's states:

* **Sending** -- the ``submit`` RPC opened a fresh turn and the opening ``userMessage`` has
  not committed yet (delivery is COMMIT, not ack -- contract A4).
* **Queued** -- ``submit`` parked the message as a pending steer of the running turn; it is a
  chip until it either commits or the turn settles without it.
* **Delivered** -- the ``userMessage`` item carrying our correlation token committed (observed
  via ``item/completed``, or durably via the ``thread/read`` uncertainty guard); the entry adopts
  the committed item's ``item.id``. Terminal.
* **Returned** -- reconcile found our token NOT committed after a settle/interrupt. Terminal; its
  text goes back to the composer.

The queue is an EPHEMERAL store (contract): it lives entirely in this in-memory ledger, which
is built per live session. There is NO durable journal -- a new session builds a fresh ledger
that starts empty, and nothing from a dead session is revived or auto-sent. An idle
``thread/status`` sweeps any still-parked entry back to the composer, so the queue is empty
whenever the agent is idle.

Delivery is decided by the committed ``userMessage`` item, never by the ack (a steer can be
accepted then interrupted before it commits). A ``userMessage`` whose ``clientId`` is ``null`` or
not one of ours is a FOREIGN message (a human typing in the visible ``--remote`` TUI, or another
client) -- the ledger emits its live user-turn (source-agnostic), but it never creates, removes,
or returns one of our chips and is not a tracked entry.

The ledger is a near-pure reducer over the client's notification callbacks plus the synchronous
:meth:`send`. Its one side effect is the model-bar mirror: on every ``thread/settings/updated`` it
writes the effective ``{model, effort, fast}`` to the agent's ``model_state.json`` (the
event-driven replacement for the fork's write), so the shared, harness-neutral model-bar read path
reconciles the chip with no codex special-casing. All logic is therefore unit-testable by driving a
:class:`CodexAppServerClient` over a scripted in-memory transport (constructor injection), with no
live daemon.

          longer live, so it is not returned.
        * The interrupted turn is over, so ``active_turn_id`` is dropped here (the dot goes IDLE at
          once, A6) and the turn is pre-marked reconciled so the out-of-band
          ``turn/completed(interrupted)`` is an idempotent no-op.
        * ``turn/interrupt`` is sent fire-and-forget -- we do NOT wait for the abort (up to several
          seconds mid-stream). The authoritative per-id reconcile completes when
          ``turn/completed(interrupted)`` lands on the subscribed stream. The accepted-then-committed
          micro-race (a live entry that committed JUST before the interrupt, whose ``item/completed``
          had not yet arrived) is optimistically Returned here and then CORRECTED to Delivered by its
          late ``item/completed`` -- :meth:`_on_item_completed` prefers the committed truth, so it is
          never double-counted.

        Bumps the interrupt generation so a send whose ``submit`` was mid-flight reconciles itself to
        Returned rather than opening a stray turn on the now-idle daemon (the in-flight-send race guard).

        Safe and idempotent when nothing is running: with no active turn and nothing live it issues no
        RPC and simply hands back whatever became non-committed since the last hand-off. The hand-off is
        once-only -- each Returned message goes to the composer exactly once, so a SECOND stop in the

        failure can be handed back in the response, below). The steps, keeping the queue continuously
        visible (A1a):

        1. Capture the Queued messages in send order and flip each to a resend-visible **Sending**
           state, so it stays a chip rendered "Sending..." through the whole interrupt+resend -- never
           removed to the composer, never blinked out. (Gated benign no-op if not available.)
        2. ``turn/interrupt`` the running turn fire-and-forget and clear it locally.
        3. Reconcile per committed id: a steer that already committed (observed via ``item/completed``)
           is Delivered -- not Queued -- so it is not captured and not re-sent; only genuinely-uncommitted
           chips ride the resend. (An unobserved just-before-interrupt commit is the accepted micro-race:
           it is re-sent and then corrected to Delivered by its own late ``item/completed``.)
        4. ``turn/start`` ONE fresh turn carrying the remaining messages concatenated in send order
           (combining required -- individually the first would open a turn and the rest re-queue). All
           remaining chips share that combined turn's fresh ``client_id``; when it commits they resolve
           to Delivered together (chip removal, then the one committed turn -- A3b). If that
           ``turn/start`` itself FAILS, the parked text is not lost: every member Returns and the
