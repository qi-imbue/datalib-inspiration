"""The one place a harness is registered.

A harness is resolved EXACTLY ONCE, in :mod:`agent_discovery`, from mngr's
``AgentDetails.type``, and carried on ``AgentInfo.harness``. Every component downstream
receives an already-resolved object from this module and never re-derives, re-checks, or
branches on the harness name.

Adding a harness is one :class:`HarnessSpec` entry here, one subclass per concern, and --
if it emits markers of its own -- one member of
:class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.events.SpecialEventKind`. Nothing else changes:
``ChatAppState`` (``state.py``) builds watchers through :func:`build_watcher`, ``agent_manager`` builds
trackers through :func:`build_tracker`, and neither names a harness.

One spec per harness rather than a dict per concern, deliberately: parallel registries
would mean two places to edit for one harness, which is how the split drifts.
