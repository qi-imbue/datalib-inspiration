"""Harness-agnostic machinery for driving a CLI's sign-in through a PTY.

Every harness signs in the same shape: spawn the CLI on a pseudo-terminal, wait
for a pattern, send some keystrokes, scrape a value the user needs (a URL or a
one-time code) off the rendered screen, and hand a value back. Only the argv,
the keystrokes and the patterns differ.

This module owns the parts that do not differ. It was extracted verbatim from
``claude/auth.py``, which is still its only caller -- the per-harness
descriptors that will make it multi-consumer arrive with the other lanes. The
extraction is deliberately behaviour-preserving: nothing here decides *what* to
scrape, only *how* to recover it from a stream that a terminal renderer has
already mangled.

Two things make that recovery non-obvious, and both are why this is a module
rather than a few inline calls:

* A CLI's renderer emits diff-based frames full of cursor positioning, so the
  raw byte order does not correspond to the visual layout. Only replaying the
  stream through a terminal emulator at the *exact* PTY geometry recovers what
  was on screen -- which is why the spawn geometry and the replay geometry are
  the same two numbers, passed together.
* A value longer than the terminal is width-wrapped across rows, so it has to
  be de-wrapped. An OSC 8 hyperlink target, when the CLI emits one, carries the
  value unwrapped and is always preferred.

Harness-specific knobs are parameters with the claude-shaped default, so the
existing caller is unchanged and a harness that differs can say so:
``frame_marker`` (Ink's synchronized-update marker -- agy emits none, in which
case the replay collapses to a single final-screen snapshot) and the PTY
geometry.
