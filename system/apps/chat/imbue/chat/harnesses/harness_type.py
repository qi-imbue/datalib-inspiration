"""The closed set of harnesses, and the one place a raw mngr type becomes one.

mngr's ``AgentDetails.type`` is an open string -- it names agent types that are not
harnesses at all (``main``, ``wait``). :func:`parse_harness` is the single boundary that
narrows it, so every field, dict key and function parameter downstream is a
:class:`HarnessType` and no component has to re-check or fall back again.

Lives in its own module rather than in ``registry.py`` because ``agent_discovery`` -- the
place the narrowing happens -- is imported *by* the registry, so the enum has to sit below
both to avoid a cycle.
