"""Is one of agy's turns open right now? -- and may we press its cancel key?

Shared by the watcher (which publishes the transcript's answer), the flush worker (the only
typist) and the tap/stop executors.

WHY THE MARKER IS ONLY EVER EVIDENCE OF BUSY. agy's statusLine writes an ``active`` marker on
every busy sample and removes it on the idle edge. A FRESH marker is therefore positive
evidence of a live turn -- but its ABSENCE proves nothing, and that asymmetry is the whole
design.

Measured on agy 1.1.20, sampling statusLine directly: it fires about every 300ms, its
vocabulary includes ``tool_use`` as well as ``idle`` and ``working``, and during a BACKGROUNDED
tool call agy reports ``idle`` and stops sampling altogether -- 33.5 seconds of silence in the
middle of a turn whose answer had not arrived. It is not lying; it genuinely has nothing to do
while the command runs. But the marker is gone for that whole window, so anything treating its
absence as "no turn is open" would type straight into that turn. (``statusline.sh``'s header
records the opposite -- 75 consecutive busy samples, zero mid-turn idle blips -- measured
against agy 1.0.6/1.0.7 across a SUBAGENT run. Both can be true: the two cases differ.)

The transcript is what carries the turn through those windows, which is why the marker is a
corroborator here and never the sole authority.

WHY EVERY RUNG IS BOUNDED. The transcript corroborates during the marker's lag windows, but a
transcript rung alone cannot terminate. Measured on agy 1.1.20: a single ctrl+c during a tool
call leaves the cancelled step ``status=CANCELED, is_terminal=True`` and the parser emits a
``tool_result`` for it -- so the tail is a ``tool_result`` forever, and a naive "tool_result
tail means the turn is open" holds every later message for the life of the agent. The first
stop would permanently wedge the agent. Every rung here therefore carries a freshness bound,
which is what guarantees the queue makes progress rather than merely conserving.
