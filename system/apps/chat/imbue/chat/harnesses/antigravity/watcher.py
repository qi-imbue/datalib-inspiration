"""Tail an antigravity (agy) agent's own conversation store and emit UI events.

Like the claude/codex watchers, this reads agy's OWN transcript -- never mngr's mirror.
agy stores each conversation as a protobuf SQLite ``.db`` (``steps`` table), so tailing is
SQLite row-offset polling rather than byte-offset file reading: each poll queries rows past
a per-conversation cursor, decodes them (:mod:`agy_transcript`), and maps them to events
(:mod:`session_parser`).

Two-phase emission gives a live activity caption: a tool step's ``tool_call`` is emitted as
soon as its row appears (even ``RUNNING``), its ``tool_result`` only once the row settles.
The cursor advances only through the leading run of terminal rows, so a row seen while
running is re-read (and its result added) once it settles; dedup by ``event_id`` keeps the
already-emitted call from repeating. A row still mid-write decodes to ``TruncatedError`` and
stops the scan for that conversation until the next pass.

No subagents in this cut: agy's ``invoke_subagent`` opens a separate conversation, which we
do not follow yet (``get_subagent_metadata`` -> None, ``is_main_session_event`` -> True).

           next mutation -- A1a's forbidden "resurfaces later".

           would resurrect it. The queue is RETURNED, never cleared: a message the user sent
           and saw accepted must end up somewhere, and silently deleting it is the swallow
           wearing a different hat.
        3. **Is a turn open?** The whole bug was that this question was never asked. Bounded on
           every rung, so a cancelled or abandoned turn cannot wedge the queue forever.
        4. **Claim.** The tracker refuses a second claim while one is open, which is the mutual
           exclusion between every typist.
        5. **Send, then look.** mngr's ack is the busy marker's mtime, which advances even for
           a message that merely parked -- so the ack is not evidence. The evidence is agy's
           own store gaining a user turn whose text is ours.
        6. **Embargo the poll thread** for the span of the send, so the turn our block becomes
           departs the queue before it arrives in the transcript (A3b) no matter which thread
           happened to scan the row first.
