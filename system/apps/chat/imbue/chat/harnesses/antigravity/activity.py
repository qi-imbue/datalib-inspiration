"""antigravity's activity tracker: the lifecycle-plus-tail inference, with one agy quirk.

The shared base owns signal caching and the universal liveness/staleness gates; this class
supplies the working-turn question plus ONE extra cached signal agy needs and the other
harnesses do not -- see :func:`_tail_is_final_answer`. The pure derivation lives beside it
in ``activity_state``. Registered in ``harnesses.registry``.
