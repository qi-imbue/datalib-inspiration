"""antigravity's model catalog and its display-only resolver.

agy's model bar is READ-ONLY. Its `/model` is an interactive TUI picker with no scriptable
one-shot form, and `--model` applies only at launch, so there is no mid-session switch to
offer: the bar reflects what agy reports and never drives it.

ONE slot, not three. agy has no separate effort or fast axis -- the tier is baked into the
model id itself (``gemini-3.7-flash-high``), and `agy models` lists each pairing as its own
row. So every option declares ``efforts=()`` and ``supports_fast=False``, which is what makes
the bar render the model chip alone (the shown slots are decided purely by the matched
option's data).

# =============================================================================================
# !!! THIS LIST MUST BE UPDATED WHEN GOOGLE SHIPS NEW ANTIGRAVITY MODELS !!!
#
# Pinning the agy BINARY does not pin this. `agy models` fetches the list over the network
# (it prints "Fetching available models..." first), so it is account- and server-side: Google
# can add or retire models with no version bump, and `update_policy = "NEVER"` does nothing
# to stop that.
#
# Captured from a signed-in `agy models` on 2026-08-21 (agy 1.1.16). Left column is agy's own
# id, right column its display name -- copied verbatim, both.
#
# A model missing from this list still renders, via the derived label in `derived_option`
# below -- but that derivation is STRING PARSING OF AN ID AND IS NOT ROBUST. It reconstructs
# "Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)" from "gemini-3.8-flash-high" by rule, so it cannot know about
# things like Claude Sonnet's "(Thinking)" suffix or GPT-OSS's capitalisation, and it will
# silently produce a slightly-wrong name for any family whose naming does not follow the
# gemini pattern. It exists so a new default model degrades to a readable name instead of a
# shrug -- NOT as a substitute for updating this list. Re-run `agy models` in a signed-in
# workspace and paste the output here whenever agy is bumped.
