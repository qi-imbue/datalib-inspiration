"""agy's queued-message store: the queue we hold on agy's behalf, and the only one that exists.

Unlike every other harness, this is NOT a mirror of a queue the harness keeps. agy parks
mid-turn input inside its TUI where it is invisible on disk, and merges all parked messages
into one turn -- so a mirror would have to reconstruct N messages from one committed turn by
matching text, which a byte-identical message typed into agy's own terminal can fool.

Instead agy is never allowed to park anything: EVERY message is held here, and one worker --
the only typist -- delivers the block once agy is idle. See
``system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract-state-of-things.md`` (E12).

LIFETIME (contract Part B). The queue must survive a chat app restart -- the
session is still alive, and "never silently dropped while the session lives" applies -- but
must NOT survive the agy session. Entries are journalled and stamped with the session's
identity; a new session clears them rather than replaying, because the contract forbids a
queue being revived or auto-sent on resume.

OWNERSHIP. Exactly one tracker per agent, for the agent's life, keyed by agent id alone. It is
the only object the watcher, the session and the tap can all reach, so it also owns the
snapshot publisher and the flush wake -- a mutation and the publish that announces it happen
under one lock, so a stale snapshot can never blank a live chip.
