"""agy's stop and shoulder tap.

Both are claude's shapes with agy's one structural advantage: **we hold the queue**, so neither
action has to retrieve anything from inside agy. See
``system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract-state-of-things.md`` (E12).

**Neither of these typists types.** The tap does not send the block; it cancels the turn and
wakes the flush worker, which is the only code in the system that delivers. Two typists meant
the tap could read a block, release the lock, press, wait out the settle -- which is exactly
the idle edge the worker is waiting for -- and then send a block the worker had already sent.

**Neither of them clears the queue.** Both take only what they accounted for. ``clear_queue``
cannot distinguish the entries captured before the chord from ones the user sent while the
chord was settling, and wiping the latter leaves them in no state at all.

The cancel key is a SINGLE ctrl+c, agy's native ``cli.escape`` action. agy reads the first as
"interrupt the active operation" and a DOUBLE press as "exit", and its documentation says that
exit valve fires regardless of how the key is remapped. A greyed button is not enough
protection for a failure that destroys the agent process, so the press goes through a shared
per-agent interlock (:meth:`TurnState.try_claim_press`) that refuses a second press inside
``MIN_PRESS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` no matter which caller asks.
