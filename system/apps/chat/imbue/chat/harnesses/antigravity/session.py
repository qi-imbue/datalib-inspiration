"""antigravity's session: the hold-the-queue send, plus the unknown-model rendering fallback.

Two reasons this subclass exists.

**Sending.** agy accepts a message mid-turn only by parking it invisibly inside its TUI,
where nothing can observe it and from where agy merges it into one turn. So this session
NEVER types: every message is enqueued, and the watcher's flush worker -- the single typist --
delivers it when no turn is open. See :meth:`send` and
``system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract-state-of-things.md`` (E12).

**The model chip.** See :meth:`switch_options`.

        Deciding here whether to type meant reading agy's state, releasing the lock (mngr
        re-acquires the same flock, and flock is per open-file-description, so holding it
        across the delegation deadlocks the process against itself), and only then typing --
        a check-then-act whose window was wide enough to land a message in a turn that had
        just started. agy parks such a message invisibly and merges it into the running turn.

        Enqueueing unconditionally removes the decision, and with it the window. One typist
        exists -- the flush worker -- so there is nothing left to race. The chip is published
        inside the tracker's lock before this returns, so the message is on screen from the
        instant it leaves the composer (contract A1a), and the worker is woken in the same
        breath, so an idle agy is typed into immediately.

        Cost, accepted deliberately: a message to an idle agy renders as a queued chip for one
        worker cycle instead of going straight to a turn. Queued is a real backend-reported
        state, so A2/A3b permit it, and it is strictly better A1a than the previous behaviour,
