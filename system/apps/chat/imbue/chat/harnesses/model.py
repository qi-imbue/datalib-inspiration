"""The shared model spine: the model-bar's harness-neutral types, the resolver
interface every harness implements, and the one matcher both validation and
display agree on.

The model bar renders ``[Model][Effort][Fast]`` from two data sources kept
strictly apart:

* the **catalog** (:class:`HarnessCatalog`) -- static, per-harness, compile-time:
  which models exist, their labels, which efforts each declares (and which of
  those show in the picker), whether each supports fast, the harness's switch
  mode, and its "powered by" credit label. Served once via ``GET /api/harnesses``.
* the **choice** (:class:`ModelChoice`) -- live, per-agent, runtime: which
  ``(model, effort, fast)`` one agent is on and the catalog option it matched.
  Rides the agents WebSocket beside ``activity_state``.

Adding a harness is one :class:`HarnessCatalog` + one :class:`HarnessModelResolver`
subclass + one registry entry -- nothing here changes. The resolver is the model
analogue of :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.activity.HarnessActivityTracker`:
AgentManager owns one per tracked agent, built from the agent's harness, and calls
it instead of branching on the harness name.
