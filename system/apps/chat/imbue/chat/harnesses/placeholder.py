"""THROWAWAY harness parts, for a harness that is registered but not yet implemented.

A harness cannot be registered without one: :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.registry.HarnessSpec`
requires a watcher, a tracker, a resolver and a catalog factory, all four abstract. So a
harness whose LAUNCH path is ready but whose transcript/model work has not started yet
would otherwise be unregisterable -- and an unregistered harness falls back to
``DEFAULT_HARNESS`` (claude) in :func:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.harness_type.parse_harness`,
which is worse than an honest blank: it would point claude's watcher at another harness's
state dir.

These are deliberately inert, not merely minimal. The watcher parses nothing and reports an
empty transcript; the resolver switches nothing; the catalog is empty (so the model bar
renders the unrecognized-model marker). The one thing that IS live is the activity dot,
because it costs two lines: both plugins that use this maintain mngr's ``active`` marker
already, so the dot tracks whether a turn is in flight even with no transcript behind it.

DELETION CRITERION: when a harness lands its real watcher/tracker/resolver/catalog, it drops
its ``placeholder.py`` and its registry entry stops naming anything here. When the last
harness stops importing this module, delete the module. Nothing here is a base class to
build on -- a real implementation replaces it outright rather than subclassing it.
