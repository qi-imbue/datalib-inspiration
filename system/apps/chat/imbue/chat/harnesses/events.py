"""The transcript event contract every harness fills.

A harness's watcher and parser turn its own transcript into the events the frontend
renders. Three core types are emitted by every harness with the same fields, so no view
needs to know which harness produced them:

    user_message        a user (or framework-injected) turn
    assistant_message   assistant text plus its tool calls
    tool_result         one tool call's output

Some harnesses record markers that are not messages -- codex writes explicit turn
boundaries to its rollout, claude's transcript has none. Those arrive as a fourth type,
``special``, carrying a ``kind`` drawn from :class:`SpecialEventKind`. Renderers ignore
them; they exist so ``/events`` reflects the true transcript and so activity derivation
has an authoritative signal.

``SpecialEventKind`` is the ONLY list of legal kinds, and each harness declares the subset
it may emit via ``HarnessSpec.special_kinds``. A harness emitting a kind outside its own
declaration is a bug its tests should catch. The frontend mirrors this enum, so an
undeclared kind is a type error there rather than an event silently dropped on the floor.

Event-id rule (the spine): every event's ``event_id`` MUST be derived from the harness's
own STABLE identity -- claude's message UUID, codex's message id / call_id / ``turn_id``,
pi's entry id -- never a physical line/counter position. A stable id
lets the store dedup a re-serialised copy, supersede an updated one in place (rather than
appending a duplicate), and re-materialise a rotated rollout without duplicating; a counter
gives a re-added entry a new id and makes those impossible. A harness synthesises an id from
content only where the source truly carries none, and does so position-independently.
