"""Seeded message-conservation storms for the three harness stop/flush executors (invariant U1).

THE PROPERTY (system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract.md A1, U1): across any
interleaving of send / park / stop / flush / restart, every accepted message ends in EXACTLY one
terminal state -- delivered (a user turn on disk), or returned-to-composer (rides a captured stop
block) -- never silently lost and never duplicated as a ghost re-queue after a replay. The one
designed-in exception is the shipped "slow-send corner" (contract E2): a send still holding
``message.lock`` past the bounded wait when a stop hammers is *stopped, never runs* -- the ledger admits that message as
KILLED, and only when the storm deliberately staged such a send.

Each storm drives the REAL executor under test -- claude's tap + stop executors over a REAL
:class:`ClaudeSessionWatcher` reading real session JSONL, and pi's flush/retract inbox writers --
against seeded rounds of interleaved operations, with REAL
``message.lock`` flock contention: an in-flight send takes the same exclusive flock mngr's send
holds (the ``server_test`` in-flight pattern) on a separate open file description BEFORE the
executor starts its bounded acquire, and a timer thread completes the send (park-then-release)
mid-acquire. What the executors cannot see -- the harness process consuming its inbox / control
file / cancel chord -- is simulated by a scripted world that replays the REAL bytes the executor
wrote, in file order, exactly as the extension / patched binary / claude would.

The op sequence is derived purely from ``_BASE_SEED`` (per-round ``random.Random``), so a failure
is replayable: every assertion message carries the seed and the full cumulative op log. Timing
races inside one op (who wins the flock) are made deterministic by construction -- the in-flight
send always holds the lock before the executor contends -- so a replay exercises the same branch.

The conservation ledger is verified after every round. Rounds listed in ``_STOP_HAMMER_ROUNDS`` /
``_FLUSH_BLOCKED_ROUNDS`` stage the expensive slow-send corner (the pi/codex executors wait the
real ``STOP_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS`` bound); all other contention resolves fast, keeping each storm
well under the runtime budget.

# Part C). That inverts what the storm has to simulate. The other storms replay the real bytes
# an executor wrote, because their harness consumes a file. agy's executor writes tmux
# keystrokes, which leave no bytes -- so the scripted world here plays agy itself: it owns the
# ``active`` marker, and "commits" a delivered block exactly as agy would, merging the whole
# block into ONE turn.

    Two things this world must model honestly, because getting either wrong validates the

    * **The marker can vanish mid-turn**, and does during a backgrounded tool call -- measured
      on agy 1.1.20, 33.5 seconds of it, while the turn's answer had not arrived. So the marker
      is modelled as evidence of busy only, never as proof of idle. (``statusline.sh``'s header
      records the opposite for a SUBAGENT run on 1.0.6/1.0.7; both are true, the cases differ,
      and a design that survives the harsher one survives both.)
    * **Typing into an open turn PARKS and MERGES.** agy does not reject it and does not give
      it its own turn -- the text is absorbed into the running turn, invisibly. So a mid-turn
      delivery is scored as a LOSS here, which is the only way a conservation ledger can see
