"""Per-agent, per-harness activity tracking.

One tracker instance holds ONE agent's cached transcript signals and knows how to
turn them into an :class:`ActivityState`. ``AgentManager`` owns a tracker per
tracked agent (built from the agent's ``harness``) and calls it instead of
branching on the harness itself.

The split is per-SIGNAL-CLASS, not per-harness:

- *Is the process alive and is this transcript current?* Universal, so the base
  :meth:`derive` applies the two gates for every harness -- a positively-dead
  lifecycle settles to IDLE (structurally, not by a caller remembering to
  override; codex's own derivation deliberately ignores the lifecycle, so this
  gate is its ONLY dead-process settle), and a transcript tail predating the
  current process's ``*_process_started`` marker is a turn abandoned by a dead
  process, not a live one.
- *Within a live process, is a turn in flight and is a tool running?* The one
  legitimately per-harness question -- :meth:`_derive_working`. claude/pi infer
  it from the lifecycle + ``active`` marker + transcript tail; codex latches its
  transcript's explicit turn markers.

Signal caching (:meth:`observe`) is likewise shared: every parser emits the same
common event schema, so the pending-tool walk and tail bookkeeping are identical;
a harness with extra signals (codex's turn latch) contributes them via
:meth:`_observe_extra`.

Adding a harness is a new subclass plus one entry in ``harnesses.registry``; no
edits to ``AgentManager``.

The per-harness derivations stay in each harness's pure ``activity_state`` peer --
the subclasses only cache signals and dispatch.

Thread-safety: a tracker holds plain mutable state and takes no lock of its own.
``AgentManager`` mutates it under ``AgentManager._lock``. The ClassVars are class
constants, so they are the members safe to read without the lock (the marker
``stat``/``exists`` calls run outside the lock on purpose, to keep filesystem
calls off the hot path).
