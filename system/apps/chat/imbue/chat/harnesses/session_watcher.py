"""The per-agent transcript watcher interface every harness implements.

One watcher instance tails ONE agent's transcript, whatever form that takes -- claude's
rotating session JSONL files, codex's single rollout -- parses new lines into the common
event schema (see :mod:`harnesses.events`), and hands them to ``on_events``. Everything
downstream of that callback is harness-blind: the server's read endpoints and the
activity tracker both work against this interface, never a concrete watcher.

``build`` takes the whole :class:`AgentInfo` rather than individual paths on purpose.
Harnesses need different pieces of it -- claude reads ``claude_config_dir``, codex does
not -- so passing individual arguments would force the CALLER to know which harness needs
what, which is exactly the knowledge this interface removes. Handing over the record lets
each implementation take what it needs and leaves ``ChatAppState`` free of harness names.

Adding a harness is a new subclass plus one entry in ``harnesses.registry``; no edits
here and none in the caller.
