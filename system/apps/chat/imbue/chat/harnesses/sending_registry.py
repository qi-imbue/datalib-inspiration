"""The backend record of messages in the *Sending* state (contract A1).

A message the UI has POSTed but the backend has not yet resolved to Delivered
(committed as a user turn), Queued (parked in the harness queue), or Returned
(the send failed) is *Sending*: accepted, in flight, not yet confirmed. Unlike a
Queued message it has no on-disk harness record yet, so the backend holds it here
for the duration of the (synchronous) send.

The one consumer that needs it is Interrupt (contract B / A4): when a stop fires
while a send is still in flight, the message never committed, so it must return to
the composer rather than be lost. The stop path reads :meth:`concatenated_block`
for exactly the still-in-flight sends (each keyed by the stable send-time id) and
folds them into the returned block.

Following the neighbouring live-state holders (:class:`QueuedSet`,
:class:`HarnessActivityTracker`) this is a plain mutable class, not a pydantic
value object: it is per-agent scratch state. It holds no lock of its own -- the
owning :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.session.FileHarnessSession`
mutates and reads it under that session's own leaf lock.
