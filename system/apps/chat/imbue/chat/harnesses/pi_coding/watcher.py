"""Tail a pi agent's native session JSONL and emit UI events.

Built on the shared :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.transcript_store` scaffolding
with a single lane: pi is one logical session to the UI. The watcher registers EVERY
session file in the sessions dir: static (pre-rotation) files are consumed once in
chronological order, then the live file (followed across ``/new`` via the
``pi_session_file`` marker) is tailed incrementally. A rebuilt watcher therefore recovers
the full cross-rotation history from disk, which is what makes eviction-on-stop safe.

Queued messages (the shoulder tap) are populated from mngr's ``pi_inbox`` -- the file mngr
appends each outgoing message to before the extension injects it: each new inbox line is an
enqueue, each newly-committed ``user_message`` a leave. Both sides are scoped to the live
process generation: the lifecycle extension archives-and-truncates ``pi_inbox`` at load (so
the enqueue replay only ever sees current-generation lines), and leaves only pop when the
``user_message`` timestamp is at or after the ``pi_process_started`` marker's mtime (so a
dead generation's drains -- including everything in the static files -- never pop
current-generation entries).
