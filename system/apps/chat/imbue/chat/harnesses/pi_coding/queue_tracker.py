"""The pi queued-message populator -- the ONLY pi-specific queue code.

Wraps one common :class:`QueuedSet` and maps pi's delivery signals onto its
``add`` / ``resolve_oldest`` / ``clear`` mutators, exactly as
:mod:`harnesses.claude.queue_tracker` does for claude. Everything downstream (the
WS snapshot field and the two common actions) is harness-agnostic.

Where claude reconstructs enqueue/leave from an opaque in-transcript ledger, pi
holds both signals explicitly and simply:

* **enqueue** = a new line in mngr's ``pi_inbox`` -- the file mngr appends each
  outgoing message to (one JSON string per line) before the lifecycle extension
  injects it into pi via ``sendUserMessage(deliverAs: "followUp")``. So it is the
  verbatim, ordered list of everything we sent. A ``<task-notification>`` / blank
  line is added as a PHANTOM (holds a FIFO slot so positional leaves stay aligned,
  but never surfaces); anything else is a REAL entry.
* **leave** = a ``user_message`` draining into pi's native transcript. followUp
  parks a message inside pi until the running turn ends; when pi finally consumes
  it, it lands as a user record -- verified live (a mid-turn send hit ``pi_inbox``
  immediately but only entered the session file once the turn ended). One drained
  user turn pops one FIFO head.
* working -> IDLE -> ``clear`` (the backstop that sweeps interrupts / crashes /
  flush-restart SIGKILLs, none of which drain a queued message).

Resolution is POSITIONAL (drop the FIFO head): the inbox carries no correlation id
back to the drained turn, so -- like claude -- the oldest parked entry leaves when
a user turn commits. The watcher drives the mutators (see ``PiSessionWatcher``): it
feeds each new inbox line to :meth:`enqueue` and each newly-ingested ``user_message``
to :meth:`leave`. A ``/new`` rotation resets the set (pi's followUp queue is gone).
