"""pi's model catalog and its (EAGER_THEN_RECONCILE) model resolver.

claude and codex declare a handful of models by hand. pi exposes over a thousand
across dozens of providers, each with its own reasoning ("thinking") levels no human
would maintain -- so pi's catalog is PARSED, in the same container, from the same
provider data files pi itself reads. The product is an ordinary
:class:`HarnessCatalog`; nothing downstream can tell a parsed catalog from a
hand-written one, except that pi's uses ``PickerMode.SEARCH`` (the option set is huge
and account-gated, so the picker is a search box, not a list).

The catalog is the master list: it supplies each model's effort levels (verbatim
strings from pi's data) and the label for whatever model an agent is on. Which models
are *offered* to a user is a separate, live concern (``pi --list-models`` for the
authed subset), handled at picker-open time, not here.

The live selection is read by the shared reader
(:func:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.model.read_model_identity`) from the uniform
``model_state.json`` the pi lifecycle extension writes at the agent state-dir root,
refreshed at session start (before the first turn), on every ``/model`` or thinking-level
change, and on resume. There is no launch default -- pi is many-provider/many-auth -- so
the bar renders no slots until the extension records a model. This resolver only owns the
WRITE (switch) side and the auth-gated picker offer set (:meth:`list_offered_models`).
