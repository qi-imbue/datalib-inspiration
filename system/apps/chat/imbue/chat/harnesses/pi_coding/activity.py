"""pi's activity tracker.

pi's transcript carries no turn-boundary markers (like claude, unlike codex), so its
tracker IS claude's -- a real subclass rather than a duplicated copy. Only the process
marker differs: mngr_pi_coding touches ``pi_process_started`` on launch/resume; its
mtime bounds transcript staleness.
