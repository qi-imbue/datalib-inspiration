"""Tests for the promote gate.

This module decides whether a folder a sign-in just wrote to actually holds a working
credential, and it is the only thing standing between "the file was written" and "the
account is offered to the user". Every arm below is a judgement about a CLI's output, so
the runner is injected rather than shelling out to whatever binaries this machine has.
