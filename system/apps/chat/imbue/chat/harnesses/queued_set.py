"""The common, harness-agnostic queued-message entity.

A message the user sends while the agent cannot start a turn for it is *queued*:
the harness has parked it and has not acted on it yet. The queued state is
ephemeral live state (like the activity dot), not a durable transcript event --
when a queued message commits it leaves the set and appears in the transcript as
an ordinary ``user_message``.

``QueuedSet`` holds that live state and ALL of the behavior the frontend and the
two common actions rely on -- the wire snapshot, and the concatenated block both
actions resend / hand to the composer. It knows nothing about any harness: the
ONLY harness-specific code is the per-harness populator that maps that harness's
raw queue signals onto ``add`` / ``resolve_oldest`` / ``clear`` (see
:mod:`harnesses.claude.queue_tracker`). Everything downstream of this entity is
common, so the two buttons can never disagree about what "the queue" is.

Following the neighbouring live-state holders (``SessionFileState``,
``HarnessActivityTracker``), this is a plain mutable class rather than a pydantic
model: it is per-session scratch state mutated in place by its populator, not a
domain value object.
