"""Tests for the shared auth-error vocabulary.

Every string below was captured from the pinned CLIs by driving them against a deliberately
bogus credential -- not written from documentation. The negatives matter as much: a rate
limit, a network failure and a model refusal all end a turn, and flagging one of those sends
the user to sign in again over something signing in cannot fix.
