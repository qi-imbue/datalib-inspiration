"""Deciding whether an account folder actually holds a working sign-in.

Used at exactly one moment: just after a sign-in flow finishes, to decide whether to commit
an account row. It is NOT a liveness check -- nothing polls this, and an account that stops
working later is discovered when a turn fails, not by asking here.

The three-way answer matters. Collapsing "could not run the probe" into "signed out" would
delete a folder the user just completed a browser OAuth into, because the probes shell out to
CLIs that fetch over the network and a 20-second hiccup is not evidence of anything.
