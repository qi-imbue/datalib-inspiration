"""One agent's live harness CONTROL surface -- the write/act half of the harness split.

The read half is :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.session_watcher.AgentSessionWatcher`
(tails the transcript into the common event schema). This class owns the actions: sending a
message (and the in-flight *Sending* records, contract A1), turn control (interrupt-to-composer
and the atomic shoulder tap), daemon liveness, and the per-agent model option set.
``HarnessSpec.session_class`` names each harness's implementation; ``AgentManager`` builds one
per tracked agent and the server endpoints dispatch through it, so neither names a harness.

Two implementations cover the three harnesses:

- :class:`FileHarnessSession` (claude, pi): the send goes through mngr's locked message API and
  the *Sending* registry lives here -- the record the interrupt paths fold into a stop's
  returned block when a send is caught mid-flight. Interrupt and tap dispatch to the harness's
  registered ``interrupt_to_composer_class`` / ``shoulder_tap_class`` (bound via
  :class:`SessionDeps`, which carries every capability as a callable so this module never
  imports the registry).
- :class:`CodexHarnessSession` (its own module, ``codex/session.py``): wraps the one live
  app-server connection + message ledger, which owns the message lifecycle natively.

Like the watchers, sessions are plain mutable live-state holders constructed via ``build``,
not pydantic models.
