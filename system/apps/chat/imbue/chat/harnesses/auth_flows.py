"""Running one sign-in against one account folder.

A flow is: mint a folder, drive the lane's method into it, and commit an index row if the
harness agrees it worked. The folder is provisional until that row exists, so every failure
path removes it.

Single-flight, deliberately. The PTY machinery this builds on holds one live session at a
time, and a user signing in is doing one thing. `flow_id` is a handle for polling, not a
licence for N concurrent flows -- starting a second flow terminates the first.

Two properties the shapes forced:

* Nothing here advances on its own. The PTY is read when a client polls, so a browser tab
  closed mid-flow would otherwise leave a CLI waiting forever -- codex's device flow polls
  for fifteen minutes. Every flow therefore arms a wall-clock timer that terminates the
  process and removes the folder.
* Success is not scraped. Two of the three PTY lanes print no success line at all, so the
  harness's own probe is what decides. Failure IS scraped, so a rejected code fails in
  seconds rather than waiting out a deadline.
