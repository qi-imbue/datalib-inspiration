"""The Claude queued-message populator -- the ONLY harness-specific queue code.

Wraps one common :class:`QueuedSet` and maps Claude's raw queue ledger onto its
``add`` / ``resolve_oldest`` / ``clear`` mutators. It is a pure function of the
ledger it is fed (plus the coarse ``on_idle`` backstop); it holds no UI state and
knows nothing about the frontend or the two common actions -- those all read the
shared entity.

The model is the conservation law ``enqueue = dequeue + remove + popAll`` (see
``docs/claude_queued_messages_impl.md``):

* ``enqueue`` -> ``add`` a FIFO entry. If the content starts with
  ``<task-notification>`` or is blank it is added as a PHANTOM (occupies a slot to
  keep positions aligned, but never surfaces); otherwise it is a REAL entry.
* dequeue / remove / popAll -> ``resolve_oldest`` (pop the FIFO head, phantom or
  real). One record = one pop; popAll emits one record per flushed message, so a
  per-record pop is uniform (no special "clear all").
* working -> IDLE -> ``clear`` (the one backstop; sweeps interrupts, SIGKILL,
  crashes -- none of which the poll loop would otherwise reconcile).

This keys resolution off the ledger's LEAVE ops ONLY -- never ``promptSource`` or
the ``queued_command`` attachment -- because in the real Minds flow every message
is delivered via mngr (typed into the TUI) and commits as a ``dequeue`` whose
``promptSource`` is "typed", which those markers do not catch. Resolution is
POSITIONAL (drop the FIFO head): the ledger carries no correlation id. There is NO
fuzzy text matching -- the only content use is the ``<task-notification>`` prefix /
blank check that decides phantom-ness, and salting the ``queued_id`` hash.

Feeding the whole ledger from the start is self-correcting: every enqueue nets
against its one leave, leaving exactly the still-parked entries, so no durable
cursor is needed. The watcher scopes the feed to the LATEST main session's
ledger only (a new session file means the process restarted and its in-memory
queue is gone) and calls ``reset`` when a new latest session is registered, so
``consume`` never sees a dead session's signals.
