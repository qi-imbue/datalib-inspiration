"""Claude's activity-state derivation.

The claude peer of :mod:`codex_activity_state`. Both consume the common event
schema and the shared primitives in :mod:`activity_state`; the harness dispatch
lives in ``agent_manager._recompute_activity_state``.

Claude has no turn-boundary events in its transcript, so "the agent is working"
is inferred from the mngr lifecycle (RUNNING) plus the transcript tail: an
unmatched ``tool_use`` means a tool is in flight, and a tail of ``user_message``
/ ``tool_result`` means claude has been handed input but has not replied yet.
