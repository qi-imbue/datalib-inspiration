"""End-to-end conformance: the claude statusline writer plus the shared reader.

This is the one test that exercises the real ``system/scripts/claude_status_line.sh`` --
the writer that lives in the dwt tree (there is no test project for ``system/scripts/``) --
against a REAL captured 2.1.207 statusline payload. It runs the script via subprocess with
the payload on stdin, then feeds the file it produced through the shared reader and matcher,
proving the writer's output and the reader agree on the uniform ``model_state.json``
contract. The fixture beside this file is a byte copy of
``docs/system/blueprint/live-model-state/statusline-payload-v2.1.207.json``.
