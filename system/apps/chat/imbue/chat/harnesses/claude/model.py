"""Claude Code's model catalog and its model resolver.

The one place Claude's model bar behavior lives: the static catalog (the models
``claude --model`` accepts, their labels, effort set, and fast support), and the
:class:`ClaudeModelResolver` that applies a change by sending Claude Code the
``/model`` / ``/effort`` / ``/fast`` slash commands. The live READ is
harness-neutral: Claude's statusline script writes the uniform
``model_state.json`` at the agent state-dir root, which the shared reader
parses; this resolver never reads it.

Claude Code exposes no stable programmatic model list, so the catalog is
maintained by hand to match the aliases ``claude --model`` accepts. Read out of the
pinned 2.1.269 binary, the full alias set is ``sonnet``, ``opus``, ``haiku``, ``fable``,
``best``, ``sonnet[1m]``, ``opus[1m]``, ``fable[1m]``, ``opusplan``; the catalog offers
four of them, leaving ``best``, ``opusplan`` and the redundant bare variants out on
purpose (``best`` and ``opusplan`` name a policy rather than a model, so neither can carry
a stable reported id).

Every offered model uses the ``[1m]`` variant to keep the 1M-token context window the
workspace provisions. In Claude Code ``[1m]`` is an explicit opt-in ("append [1m] to the
model name for 1M"), so the bare alias hands back a smaller window than the workspace
paid for. Both forms are accepted and both report the same display name, which is why
the difference is invisible at the ``/model`` prompt -- ``/model fable`` and ``/model
fable[1m]`` each answer "Set model to Fable 5.1". Do not take an API-level claim that a
model's default context is already 1M as licence to drop the suffix: that is a property
of the model, and this is a property of the harness. Haiku has no ``[1m]`` variant.

The switch alias and the reported id are different strings, and the suffix shows up in
both: an agent launched as ``opus[1m]`` reports ``claude-opus-5[1m]``. Fast mode is an
Opus-only capability (2.1.269 scopes it to "Opus 5/4.8") -- notably NOT a property of
the most capable model, so do not infer it from rank.

The picker offers exactly four models -- Fable 5.1, Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5. Every
other option is declared with ``in_picker=False``: matchable if a live read reports it,
never offered. That set is defined by what the four do NOT cover, so an agent sitting on
a model the picker cannot reach still shows a name instead of falling through to the
shrug case. Three ways in: an approved org launching Mythos, a chat that was created on
an older pin and is still sitting on Fable 5, and a user typing ``/model opus-4-8``
straight into the underlying Claude Code session, which the picker neither offers nor
prevents. The ``ultra`` effort (ultracode) is declared-but-hidden the same way.

Each option's ``harness_reported_model_id`` is the suffix-free API id
(``claude-opus-5``), matched against a live read. An option launched with the ``[1m]``
suffix reports it too (``claude-opus-5[1m]``), which reaches the same option through
:func:`match_option`'s prefix pass rather than by an exact key hit. That prefix pass
walks the options in catalog order and takes the first key the reported id starts with,
so the catalog is ordered such that no key precedes a longer key it prefixes: a point
release comes before its family (``claude-fable-5-1`` before ``claude-fable-5``), and the
bare family catch-alls (``claude-opus-4``) that would swallow their dated siblings come
last. A test pins that no earlier key shadows a later one.

Hidden options are not decoration: they make the catalog complete against what the
harness can report, and each says what its model actually does. ``supports_fast`` follows
the binary (only Opus 4.8 among them has fast). Efforts stay permissive -- per-model
effort support is not stated plainly anywhere and the matching gate gives a shrug on a
level the option does not declare, so guessing narrow trades a real risk for nothing.

# Everything the four offered models do NOT match, so the catalog is complete against
# what the harness can report: Mythos (approved orgs only) and every previous-generation
# model 2.1.269 still carries. These are not offered, but they are not decoration either
# -- they exist so the catalog describes the whole model surface, and each one should say
# what its model actually does.
#
# supports_fast therefore follows the binary rather than being set permissively. 2.1.269
# scopes fast to "Opus 5/4.8", so Opus 4.8 declares it and nothing else does -- 4.7 and
# 4.6 had fast removed, which is also why their legacy claude-opus-4-*-fast ids are dead
# and cannot arrive with fast on. Note the field gates MATCHING, not just rendering: a
# live read of a model with fast on shrugs unless that model declares it. Opus 4.8 with
# fast on is a reachable state, hence the exception; the rest are not.
#
# Efforts do NOT follow the same rule and stay permissive. Per-model effort support is
# not something the binary states plainly (Opus 4.5 takes low/medium/high, Sonnet 4.5
# rejects the axis outright), and the same matching gate applies -- a level an option
# does not declare is a shrug. Guessing narrow there trades a real risk for no benefit,
# since a hidden option's effort set is never shown in a picker.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. match_option's prefix pass takes the FIRST key the reported id
# starts with, so a general key placed before a specific one swallows it -- claude-opus-4
# ahead of claude-opus-4-8 would label every dated Opus 4.x as "Opus 4". Specific keys
# come first and the bare family catch-alls last; the ordering is pinned by a test. The
# catch-alls are what absorb the dated Opus 4 / Sonnet 4 ids (claude-opus-4-20250514),
# whose alias form (claude-opus-4-0) is not a prefix of them.
