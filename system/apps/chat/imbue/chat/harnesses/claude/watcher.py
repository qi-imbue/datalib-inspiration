"""Watch raw Claude session JSONL files and emit parsed events.

Built on the shared :class:`~imbue.chat.harnesses.transcript_store` scaffolding:
one lane per session file (main sessions plus subagents), every parsed event fully
resident, and per-event source byte ranges kept beside the store for the on-demand payload
reads.

What stays claude-specific:

* **Discovery.** Main sessions come from ``claude_session_id_history`` in first-mention
  order (a resume re-lists the same id; a late-found session is inserted by its history
  position so the latest-session gates below stay aimed at the live session). Subagent
  sessions live under ``<session>/subagents/`` beside each main file, with a
  ``<id>.meta.json`` carrying display metadata plus the spawn-time ``toolUseId`` link.

* **The queue feed.** Claude records its live queue as out-of-band ``queue-operation``
  ledger lines. Only the LATEST main session's ledger mirrors the live process's queue,
  and -- because ``--resume`` re-appends to the same file -- enqueues stamped before the
  ``claude_process_started`` marker belong to a dead process and are excluded on replay
  (see :func:`_is_dead_epoch_enqueue`).

* **Subagent enrichment.** A parent Agent tool_call's ``subagent_metadata`` can land after
  the parent was already emitted (the subagent's meta.json shows up a cycle later, or its
  tool_result later still). Because events are resident, enrichment simply mutates the
  parent in place; a parent still missing metadata sits in a pending set retried each
  refresh, and a change registers a re-broadcast so the client upgrades its held card.

Lock discipline (owned by the shared base): the one lock is held across discovery, file
reads, and parsing -- cheap and incremental -- but never across the ``on_events`` fan-out
or the queue-snapshot callback.
