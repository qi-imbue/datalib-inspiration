"""Claude's native shoulder tap: flush the parked message queue into the live turn.

The shoulder-tap contract (system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/messages-lifecycle-contract.md, Part B) for
claude, WITHOUT the SIGKILL-restart the base ``/flush-queue`` path uses. Cancelling
claude's live turn makes it flush its parked queue through immediately -- the same auto-flush it performs at natural turn end. We
trigger that flush early by delivering a Chat-only ``meta+q`` -> ``chat:cancel`` chord
(mngr provisions the binding; ``meta+q`` is inert in every non-Chat context, so a stray
delivery can never be reinterpreted as ``confirm:no`` / ``autocomplete:dismiss`` / ...).

The keypress itself is NOT done here: dwt never drives raw tmux. It routes through mngr's
in-process message API (``send_key_chord_to_agents`` -> ``press_key_chord``), which holds
the same per-agent ``message.lock`` as a text send, so the chord can never interleave with
a half-delivered message. This module owns only the orchestration around that keypress:
the refresh-first gate, the live-session byte baseline, the bounded verdict watch, and the
one recovery message for the cancelled-follow-on race. The abort-and-capture pieces
(``resolve_live_session_baseline`` / ``watch_for_flush_verdict``) and the pure verdict
lattice are factored so the sibling plan-claude-interrupt path can reuse them.

The watch is biased toward *never losing* a message: it fast-exits FLUSHED once the mirror has
drained AND the flush is confirmed to have started a turn -- either the turn produced an answer OR
a turn was seen alive at some poll since the chord (it started; a quick turn may start and finish
inside the window). A drained mirror with a dangling interrupt sentinel where a turn was NEVER seen
alive is NEEDS_RECOVERY (the flush committed the messages but nothing ran to answer them -- the
cancelled follow-on). A mirror that never drains is NOT_FLUSHED -- so the accepted failure modes
are a spurious recovery message or a spurious 500 (both visible), never a silently stranded queue.

This module ALSO owns claude's stop button (Contract B) for the EMPTY-queue case
(:class:`ClaudeInterruptToComposer` / :func:`execute_claude_stop_to_composer`): the same
``meta+q`` chord, but resolved as a pure interrupt -- confirm the abort by the interrupt
sentinel appearing past the baseline (either shape), then mark the agent idle -- rather than
a flush. A NONEMPTY queue (or a dialog, inactive binding, or unconfirmed abort) delegates to
the base restart-drain, with the mirror refreshed and the block captured under mngr's bounded
per-agent ``message.lock`` -- so a message an in-flight send parks mid-stop rides the returned
block instead of dying silently with the SIGKILL; when the bounded wait expires, stop still
wins on a fresh best-effort re-capture. The two paths share the same module so the stop's cancel chord and
the tap's recovery arm coordinate through one in-process stop-timestamp registry: a stop
pressed inside the tap's watch suppresses the tap's recovery resend (it would otherwise
re-drive the just-stopped turn).

      an in-flight send parked since the pre-lock read rides the block instead of dying with the

    - Mirror EMPTY, no ``active`` marker -> ``""``: no turn, nothing queued; composer untouched.
    - Mirror EMPTY, a dialog / inactive binding / no live session -> the base (same bounded-lock
      capture): the Chat-only chord is inert or unobservable, but a blocked turn is still a turn.
    - Mirror EMPTY + open turn + bindable -> the chord: re-check under the bounded lock (a
      mid-flight send that parked while we waited routes back to the base, captured under that
      same hold; a lock still held past the wait routes straight to the hammer instead of
      stalling the stop behind the send's turn-confirm), deliver ``meta+q``, then watch.

    Whenever the bounded ``message.lock`` acquire EXPIRES -- a send is still in flight and has not
    committed -- the aborted Sending message is returned to the composer alongside the queued block
    (contract A4/B: return every not-Delivered message). ``get_in_flight_block`` supplies that text
    (the Sending records the send endpoint keeps on the watcher); it is folded in ONLY on the
    lock-not-held branches, because acquiring the lock means the send resolved (committed/queued)
    and cleared its own record, so adding it there would risk returning an already-committed
    message. On the chord path (lock acquired, mirror empty) the block is therefore empty. Every
    branch that carries a real block goes through ``restart_drain_to_base``. ``press_chord`` /
    ``mark_idle`` / ``settle_activity`` / ``restart_drain_to_base`` / ``try_message_lock`` /
    ``get_in_flight_block`` are injected so the override wires the real mngr boundaries (the
    endpoint's ``reset_activity_state`` for ``settle_activity``) and tests substitute fakes; each
    ``try_message_lock()`` call is one bounded acquire of mngr's per-agent ``message.lock``
    (waiting at most the shared ``STOP_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS``), yielding whether the lock was taken.
