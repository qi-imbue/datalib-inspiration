"""HTTP endpoint handlers for `/api/claude-auth/*`: the auth status and the pasted-credential submit.

Kept in a separate module from server.py so server.py doesn't grow with
the modal-specific logic. The status route reads the `ClaudeAuthService`
(read-only: it reports claude's auth state and changes nothing); the
submit route hands the pasted credential to the `AuthFlowService`, which
adopts it as an account. Both are created once in
`main.build_production_state` (or by the test state builder) and stored
on the app's `ChatAppState`, which each handler reads via `get_state()`.
