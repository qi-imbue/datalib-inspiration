"""Lanes: the (AI provider + harness) pairings a user can sign in to, and how each signs in.

The UI calls these "providers". Internally they are lanes, because "provider" is already
three other things in this tree -- a compute provider in mngr, an AI vendor, and one of pi's
own provider ids -- and because a lane is what a chat picks and then stays in.

Several lanes can share a harness: Opencode Go and bring-your-own-key both run on pi. So a
lane is not a harness with a nicer name; it is a *destination*, and the harness is how you
get there.

Each lane lists its sign-in methods, primary first. That mirrors what the Claude modal
already does -- one recommended path with the alternates behind a disclosure -- generalised
so every lane can have its own alternates.

Every value in the table below was measured against the real CLIs, not read off
documentation, which was wrong about several of them. Notably: codex's `--device-auth` is
absent from `codex login --help` but is what bare `codex login` tells you to use on a
headless box, and it inverts the usual shape -- the code comes OUT and nothing is pasted
back.
