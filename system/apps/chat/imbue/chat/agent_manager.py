        used one. With no accounts at all the create is refused (the instances API reserves
        the chat instead, see ``reserve_chat``).

        ``message`` is the first message the chat sends once it runs, delivered by ``mngr

        A seeded chat does not claim the workspace's first chat: the ``first`` template and its
