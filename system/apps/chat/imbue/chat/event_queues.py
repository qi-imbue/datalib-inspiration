    Delivery is live-only: nothing is buffered for replay, because every event is
    recoverable over the REST ``/events`` endpoint -- the stream is a low-latency hint and
    the REST snapshot is the source of truth.

    Each connection's queue is bounded, and a consumer whose queue overflows is evicted on
    the FIRST full ``put``: unlike the agents WebSocket's snapshot traffic (where the next
    snapshot supersedes a dropped one), one dropped transcript delta silently desyncs the
    stream, so the only honest response is closing it -- drain the queue and push the
    ``None`` sentinel so the handler thread exits and the client's reconnect-with-snapshot
    resyncs it.
