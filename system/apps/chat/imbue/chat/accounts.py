"""The account store: one folder per signed-in provider account, plus an index.

An account IS a folder. Nothing about which provider it belongs to, who signed in, or what
it is called lives on disk -- the folder name is random and carries no meaning, so a folder
can never drift out of sync with, or be mistaken for, the identity the UI shows. All of that
lives in one index file, which is the sole source of truth.

Signing in twice to the same real account is fine and expected: two folders that look
identical from outside. When a login expires the user makes a new one and deletes the old,
so there is deliberately no dedupe, no identity scraping, and no liveness probing anywhere
in this module.

The commit point is the INDEX WRITE, not the folder. A flow mints a folder, drives the CLI
into it, and only then commits a row. That ordering means an interrupted sign-in leaves a
folder with no row -- which `reconcile` removes at boot -- rather than a row
pointing at a half-authenticated folder the UI would offer as usable.

Concurrency: the operations that mutate the index are served concurrently by Flask. An
atomic rename prevents a *torn* file, not a *lost update*, so every
mutation takes `_index_lock` across the whole read-modify-write -- an flock, because the
server is not the only process that writes here.
