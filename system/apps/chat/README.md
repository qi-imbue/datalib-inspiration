# The chat app

The agent harness UI: live conversations with mngr-managed agents, one page per
chat, rendered inside a tab's iframe at the chat's own registered origin. It is
an app of the workspace like the terminal or the file viewer (the workspace app
model, `docs/system/blueprint/workspace-app-model/`): the shell knows it only
through its manifest (`app.toml`), its registry row, its instances API, and the
browser-side contract.

## What it serves

The `chat` program (declared in `system/supervisord.conf.d/chat.conf`) runs
`chat-app`, the console script of this package, from its own uv tool environment
(installed by `system/scripts/build_workspace.sh` with the mngr harness plugins
`system/config/mngr_plugins.toml` assigns to `chat`). At startup it registers
its manifest and port 8010 through `system/scripts/forward_port.py`, starts
`mngr observe` for the workspace's agents, and serves:

- `GET /<chat-id>` (and `/<chat-id>.<agent-id>.<session-id>` for a subagent view): the
  chat document, the built `chat.html` with the chat's ids, the workspace
  hostname, and the terminal app's origin label in meta tags.
- `/_instances`: the instances API of `contracts.md` section 4.3 over the agent
  manager (`instances.py`): every chat (a non-primary agent, today) is an
  explicit, renameable, stoppable instance keyed by its chat id (stop is `mngr
  stop`, start the same ensure-started path a send takes); a chat that is not an
  agent yet is a referenced provisional instance under the id mngr will give its
  first agent, whether it is waiting for an account (`attention`), being created
  (`working`), or failed (`error`); a subagent view is a referenced instance
  keyed `<chat-id>.<agent-id>.<session-id>`. A chat's status comes from its
  active agent's activity state, a pending permission request, and the
  lifecycle. The API answers `503` until the agent list has been read from mngr
  once.
- Every `/api/chats/<chat-id>/...` route (events, streams, sends, model choice,
  the queue actions, presence, destroy, start, stop; the subagent reads under
  `/api/chats/<chat-id>/agents/<agent-id>/subagents/<session-id>/`),
  `/api/chats/create`, `/api/chats`, `/api/harnesses`, `/api/uploads`,
  `/api/claude-auth`, `/api/accounts`, `/api/lanes`, and `/api/latchkey`. Every
  per-chat route, `/api/chats/create`, and the subagent reads are also served
  under their older `/api/agents/...` spelling, whose id is read as a chat id;
  `/api/agents` stays the plain listing of every mngr agent.
- `/api/ws`: the chat pages' socket, carrying `chats_updated` (a `ChatSnapshot`
  per chat, the agent-level facts under `active_agent`) and the provisional-chat
  events (`provisional_chat_created`, `provisional_chat_completed`).
- `/api/health`: `{"status", "is_frontend_built"}`, the probe the update apply
  polls on the `--preflight` boot (after the restart it polls `/_instances`, the
  route that answers only once the agent manager has its first list).
- Agent-authored files by their absolute on-disk path (`file_serving.py`), so a
  chat's markdown can show an image the agent wrote.

The chat page talks to the shell only through the browser-side contract
(`shell:open`, `shell:focused`, the handshake) and the shell reaches the chat
only over loopback (the instances API, the relay). Sends are reported to the
shell's client-activity route so agents can attribute a request to a client.

A chat is a sequence of agent transcripts run by one agent at a time
(`docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/`); its id is its first agent's id, a
`ChatId` in code (`primitives.py`), and every agent this app creates carries it
as `MINDS_CHAT_ID` in its environment. Today every chat is its one agent, and
the places that assume so are marked `CLEANUP`. The read routes go through
`chat_transcript.py`, the chat's transcript as its agents' segments in order.

The send route is also how anything inside the workspace messages a chat:
`system/scripts/message_chat.py` posts to it by chat id (the browser app's
wake-ups, a lead's replies to a worker, the automation runner) and falls back
to `mngr message` only when the chat app cannot be reached or does not know the
chat. A send that names no client (no `client_id`, `device_kind`, or
`active_layout`) posts no client-activity report. The route answers 503 until
the agent list has been read from mngr once, like the instances API, so a send
during the app's first seconds is retried rather than mistaken for an unknown
chat. See `docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/`.

## Provider accounts

Accounts live under `~/.minds/accounts` (`accounts.py`): one folder per
signed-in provider account plus an index, minted by the sign-in flows
(`harnesses/auth_flows.py`) the chat page's provider chooser drives. A chat
binds to an account when it is created and never changes it. A launch that names
no account (the New Tab tile, a rail shortcut, `layout.py open chat`) goes to the
account the user pinned as the default in a chat's provider menu, else to the
most recently used one; pressing another account in that menu offers to launch a
new chat on it. `system/scripts/migrate_claude_auth.py` imports this package from
the root venv.

The same default reaches every `mngr create` in the workspace that names no
harness and no account -- the chats the Minds app starts from outside, workers,
automations, the caretaker -- through `.mngr/settings.local.toml`, mngr's
git-ignored local config layer (`create_defaults.py`). The account store writes
it on every index write and at boot: `[commands.create]` with the default
account's harness as `type`, its binding (`env__extend` for claude, an
`extra_provision_command__extend` credential link over `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR`
for codex, agy and pi) and the `account=<id>` label a re-auth restarts agents
by. The pin and the most recently used account stay in `index.json`; the file is
derived from them and nobody is expected to edit it, though keys outside the
managed ones survive every rewrite. With no usable account the managed keys are
removed, and a create in the workspace is then refused by
`system/scripts/require_create_account.py` (mngr's `pre_command_scripts.create`
entry in `.mngr/settings.toml`) with a message that says to sign in.

A chat created from outside the workspace with an `auto_open` or `assist` label
(the Minds app's update and help chats) has its tab surfaced by this app
(`auto_open.py`): when the agent appears, the app asks the shell to open the
chat's address in every connected client, holds the open until a client is
connected if none is, and records the delivery under
`data/.apps/chat/auto_opened_chats.json` so a restart never re-pops a tab. The
open is held for as long as the chat exists, so a chat started while nobody was
connected still gets its tab whenever someone finally connects. The one
exception is a workspace with no ledger to read (its chats predate this app
keeping one, or the file was lost): every labeled chat it already has is adopted
as shown, since a tab for each is worse than missing one.

## Development

```bash
# Backend, from the repo root (the app's data paths are relative to it)
uv run chat-app --no-register

# Tests
cd system/apps/chat
uv run pytest
```

`--no-register` boots the app without re-pointing the live chat row in the
registry, for a throwaway boot on another port (`CHAT_PORT`).

`--preflight` is the update apply's throwaway boot (`.agents/skills/update-self`):
the app imports, builds, and serves `/api/health` but reconciles no accounts (the
boot sweep reaps sign-in processes), starts no agent manager (so no `mngr observe`,
session sweep, memory prioritizer, or nudges to the shell), and registers nothing.
The apply boots the merged chat this way on a free port before restarting the live
services, since this is the process that imports mngr and the harness plugins, and
refuses the update when it cannot come up.

The frontend lives in `frontend/` and builds into `imbue/chat/static/`; see
`system/apps/README.md` for the shared frontend library and the npm
workspace both frontends belong to.

## Memory shedding

The chat app re-tags chat agents' `oom_score_adj` from live activity
(`oom_prioritizer.py`), fed by the pages' presence reports and by its own send
path, and keeps each chat's last-messaged stamp under `data/.apps/chat/` so a
restart seeds the ranking from real history. The app itself runs in the `chat`
band, just above the shell.
