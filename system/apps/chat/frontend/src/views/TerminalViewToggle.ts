/**
 * The switch that turns a chat over to its agent's terminal.
 *
 * The chat and the terminal are two renderings of one conversation, so this reads as a view
 * setting rather than a place to navigate to -- which is why it is a switch and not a button,
 * and why it sits in the composer's under-bar next to the model.
 *
 * It is the SAME switch as the combo card's fast-mode row, classes and all. An earlier version
 * scaled it down here with its own CSS, which set `transform: translateX(...)` on a knob whose
 * offset already comes from a Tailwind `translate-x-[22px]` utility -- the utility won, and a
 * 22px throw in a 32px track put the knob outside it. One switch, one size, no overrides.
