/**
 * When a conversation has used up its fast-mode grace period.
 *
 * The workspace's first chat runs fast so it feels responsive, then asks
 * whether to keep paying for that (see models/FastModePrompt.ts). This module
 * decides when "then" is: it counts the conversation's completed user turns and
 * reports whether the prompt is now owed.
 *
 * The prompt is agent-scoped and harness-declared: it fires only for an agent
 * whose harness declared the `fast_mode_prompt` turn check (claude, codex),
 * that carries the `first=true` label (the one chat the `first` template
 * launched fast), and that has not been asked before.
 *
 * A turn is counted exactly as the transcript view counts one, by reusing the
 * same boundary rule the timeline groups on -- so "5 turns" means the five
 * exchanges the user can actually see, not five raw transcript lines. Permission
 * verdicts are excluded on top of that: the timeline treats them as turn
 * boundaries (see buildSections) but they are the app talking to itself, not the
 * user taking another turn.
