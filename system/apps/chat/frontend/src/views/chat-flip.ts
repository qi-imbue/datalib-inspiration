/**
 * The chat card: one conversation, two renderings, and the switch that turns it over.
 *
 * A chat and its agent's terminal are the same conversation shown two ways, so they are the
 * front and back of one surface rather than two places to be.
 *
 * Kept out of `ChatPanel` because the two rules below are the whole risk of this feature and
 * both are invisible in review -- a card assembled inline would have them buried in six hundred
 * lines of transcript machinery, and ChatPanel's dependency surface makes it impractical to
 * test. Here they are three arguments and a DOM assertion.
