/**
 * The confirmation dialog for removing (signing out of) a provider account, shared by the
 * provider chooser and the account flyouts so the wording and the weight of the decision
 * stay identical everywhere.
 *
 * A layered modal rather than an armed two-step button: the armed "Remove?" morph put its
 * consequences text wherever the list had room -- easy to miss below the rows -- and a
 * destructive decision deserves a screen of its own with an explicit Cancel.
