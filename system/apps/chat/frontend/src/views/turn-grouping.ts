/**
 * Step grouping: a single in-order walk of the transcript.
 *
 * The progress view is a pure frontend for the agent session transcript.
 * BOTH structure and decoration come from the transcript -- there is no
 * side-channel.
 *
 * - *Structure* (which steps exist, their order, their open/close transitions,
 *   which events belong to which step) is read from transcript position. tk
 *   lifecycle commands (`tk create/start/close`) appear as Bash tool calls;
 *   their results carry the canonical id and status (`Updated <id> -> <status>`),
 *   which is all the structure we need.
 * - *Decoration* (titles, close summaries) is read from the machine-readable
 *   lines tk prints on stdout: `Created <id>: <title>` (create),
 *   `tk-step <id> title: <title>` (start/close), and
 *   `tk-step <id> summary: <summary>` (close). These are parsed in one global
 *   pass over all events into a per-id decoration map, so a carried-over node
 *   resolves its title from the `tk start`/create line in an earlier turn.
 * - For *historical* transcripts that predate those output lines, a best-effort
 *   input-preview fallback recovers titles/summaries from the tk command inputs
 *   (`tk create --step "Title"`, `tk close <id> "summary"`). It is allowed to be
 *   imperfect; it serves a frozen corpus only.
 *
 * The walk maintains a single "current open step": events while a step is open
 * group under it; events while none is open fall into an ungrouped run rendered
 * inline (the same plain-chat path used for turns with no steps). When a step
 * closes, any prose it spoke after its last work is ejected into the ungrouped
 * inline stream right after the step node, so a closing remark is promoted out
 * of the step rather than buried in it. The turn's wrap-up reply is simply the
 * final run of ungrouped prose, rendered below the timeline.
 *
 * A system chip (Stop-hook feedback, a background-task notice, a fleet nudge)
 * splits a step into *stints*, and that ejection runs per stint. Prose closing a
 * stint is a delivered reply, and the chip's POSITION is what proves it: a chip
 * is a user-side line, so it only arrives at a request boundary, which leaves it
 * two possible spots. Either it follows a tool result -- the stint ends in work
 * and ejection has nothing to take -- or it follows prose, which can only happen
 * when that response ended with text and no tool call, i.e. the agent stopped
 * there. Work it does once woken must not retroactively bury that reply inside
 * the step that happened to still be open.
 *
 * A step still open when the next user message arrives carries over: it
 * re-renders at the top of the new turn, while the prior turn's node freezes at
 * its last-known state.
 *
 * One message is never grouped under a step: an agent permission request. It
 * is lifted out into a dedicated inline break (the `permission` timeline item)
 * so the user always sees it and can respond without expanding a step. The step
 * it interrupted stays open, so work resumed afterwards keeps grouping under it.
 * When the user later grants or denies the request, the app injects a plain
 * notification user message. The walk reads its verdict onto the request's card
 * and treats the notification as a turn boundary (the agent blocked on the
 * request and is now resuming), so any open step carries over and continues in
 * the new turn rather than the same node resuming beneath the card. The raw text
 * isn't shown (its verdict is on the card). The notification carries the
 * resolved request's own id (see message-classification's resolutionRequestIdOf),
 * so a card looks up its verdict by that id rather than by arrival order: two
 * requests resolved out of the order they were created never swap their
 * cards' verdicts, and a message that batches more than one permission request
 * resolves each of its cards independently. A notification with no id (recorded
 * before minds embedded ids) attributes nothing here -- an embedded page
 * recovers such verdicts from the response log via the card's hydration query.
 *
 * This module reads no timestamps. Pending placeholders are ordered by
 * transcript position; grouping and the positioning of any transitioned step
 * read transcript order alone.

 *  A *stint* is a run of one step's events uninterrupted by a system chip.
 *  Prose at the end of a stint is a delivered reply, proven by where the chip
 *  sits rather than by what kind of chip it is: an injected user-side line only
 *  arrives at a request boundary, so it either follows a tool result (the stint
 *  ends in work, and there is nothing to eject) or follows prose, which happens
 *  only when that response ended with text and no tool call -- the agent
 *  stopped there. Both halves are visible in any transcript: a text block never
 *  follows a tool_use inside one response, and an injected line never lands
 *  directly after a text-only one. That makes the rule independent of WHEN the
 *  harness delivers a chip, including one it queued while the agent was busy.
 *
 *  Without the split, work the agent does after being woken would retroactively
 *  turn that reply into mid-step narration and bury it inside the collapsed
 *  step -- the step happened to still be open, so the prose stopped being
 *  "after the step's last work".
 *
 *  The live frontier step's LAST stint is exempt: nothing has ended it, so its
 *  trailing prose is in-flight narration shown as a caption (see step 3). Its
 *  earlier stints are not exempt -- a chip ended each of those.
