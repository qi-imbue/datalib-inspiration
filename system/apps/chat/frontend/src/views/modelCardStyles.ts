 * geometry that reserves a lane for each of a row's trailing controls.
 *

 * emits NOTHING for an unknown utility, so a name this app does not define is a
 * silent no-op with no build error to catch it (`providerSignInStyles.test.ts`
 * guards both this module and the chooser's against exactly that).
