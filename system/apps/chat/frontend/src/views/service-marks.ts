/**
 * The bundled brand mark for a permission scope's service.
 *
 * The artwork is minds' own service-icon set, reached through the vendored mngr
 * tree rather than copied into this repo a second time: `system/vendor/mngr` is
 * a snapshot of the mngr monorepo refreshed by the release sync, and the same
 * seam already supplies this frontend with the embed contract (see the alias in
 * vite.config.ts). Globbing it means the two surfaces cannot drift, and the
 * marks become ordinary build assets -- so the card needs no network round trip
 * and looks the same embedded in the minds app and opened directly in a browser.
 *
 * A scope is a latchkey service name plus a transport suffix (`slack-api`,
 * `google-gmail-api`, `github-rest-api`), and the mark files are keyed by that
 * same service name, so the service is one of the scope's hyphen-prefixes.
 * Trying the longest first is the rule the backend's own scope resolver uses
 * (`candidate_services` in latchkey_endpoints.py); it is what separates
 * `github-rest-api` -> `github` from `github-rest`.

// theme. This UI has one (light) theme, so they are excluded by the glob rather
// than filtered afterwards -- a matched file is imported, and so emitted into

// `no-inline` keeps each mark an emitted file instead of a data URI folded into
// the bundle: only the one mark a card actually shows is ever fetched.
