 * One account row in a provider flyout: the chat's model card lists its accounts with it.
 *
 * What a row CLICK does is the caller's; the trailing controls are the row's own: the default
 * star, a rename pencil, a sign-out bin, and the tick marking the current account. Those
 * controls carry the only fiddly logic here (arming, an inline field, three ways out of an
 * edit).
 *
 * State stays with the CALLER. The menu already owns the lifecycle its controls hang off --
 * an open removal confirmation belongs to the flyout it was opened from and has to be
 * cleared when that flyout closes -- and a module-level store here could not see the menu
 * closing.
