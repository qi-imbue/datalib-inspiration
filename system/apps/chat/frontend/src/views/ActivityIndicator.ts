/**
 * Activity strip that sits just above the message input -- the harness-common shell.
 *
 * The backend (the chat app) is the source of truth for *which* state the agent
 * is in -- IDLE / THINKING / TOOL_RUNNING -- delivered on ``activity_state`` via the
 * ``chats_updated`` WS payload. This component's job is to render a label:
 *   - IDLE / null      -> hidden
 *   - THINKING         -> "Thinking…"
 *   - TOOL_RUNNING     -> the in-flight tool call, captioned by the agent's harness
 *
 * The TOOL_RUNNING caption is read straight off the tool call: the harness's own
 * parser labelled it, so this view needs no notion of which harness is running.
 * A null ``activity_state`` means the server has no per-agent activity tracking
 * for this chat (provisional chats, remote agents) -- the strip collapses.
 *
 * One state has no backend signal at all: the beat between the user resolving a
 * permission request and the agent being told. The verdict reaches this page
 * over the embed contract the moment the user clicks (see `permission-card.ts`),
 * but the agent only resumes once the desktop client's retried `mngr message`
 * delivery actually lands the notice in its session -- until then the agent is
 * genuinely IDLE and the strip would show nothing, so the user sees their
 * decision land and then apparent silence. Through that gap the strip says
 * `WAKE_LABEL`, bounded by `WAKE_SPINNER_MS`.
