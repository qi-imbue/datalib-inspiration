/**
 * The provider chooser's own class strings: the layout and the few looks that

 *
 * Everything with a shared recipe behind it is NOT here -- buttons come from
 * `components/Button`, text fields from `components/Input`, the panel frame from
 * `components/Modal`, the key picker from `components/menu`, colour from the
 * semantic utility layer and size from the `type-*` roles. What remains below is
 * the residue: the four panel sizes, the row shapes the flow lists things in, and
 * the verdict screen.
 *
 * A note for anyone extending this: nothing here is exempt from the design
 * system. An earlier pass carried this flow's styling over wholesale from a
 * design prototype, which left it speaking a private vocabulary -- its own
 * button, its own input, its own scrim, its own stacking layers -- beside an app
 * that already had all four. If a look you need exists in `components/`, use it;
 * if it does not, add it there rather than here.
