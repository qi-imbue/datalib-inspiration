/**
 * Provider accounts and the sign-in flows that create them.
 *
 * A "lane" is an AI provider reached through a particular harness -- what the UI calls a
 * provider. Several lanes can share a harness (Opencode Go and a raw API key both run on
 * Pi), so the chooser lists lanes, not harnesses.
 *
 * A sign-in has three possible shapes and the server tells us which, per method, so nothing
 * here has to know what a harness is:
 *
 *   url_then_code   here is a link; approve in the browser and paste the code back
 *   code_then_wait  here is a link and a one-time code; type it there and we wait
 *   paste           paste a key; no terminal involved
 *
 * Flows are single-flight on the server -- it holds one live sign-in at a time -- so this
 * keeps one flow's state and starting another abandons the first.
