 * efforts each declares, which are shown) and the switch mode. The per-chat live
 * selection arrives separately, on the chats WebSocket as each chat's active agent's
 * `model_choice` (see Chats.ts). The backend already computes which catalog
 * option a live choice matched, so the frontend never re-matches. The provider a chat runs on
 * is not here either -- the combo card reads it from the chat's own account label.
