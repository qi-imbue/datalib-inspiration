"""In-mind Claude authentication: settings-env credential writes, setup-token flow, agent restarts.

Implements the backend half of the in-UI Claude login modal. All credentials
live in the ``env`` block of the shared ``~/.claude/settings.json`` (the
config dir every claude in the mind resolves by claude's own default --
``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` is deliberately unset workspace-wide), NEVER in the
mngr host env file: the host env file is frozen into long-lived processes
(supervisord and its services) at boot, so changing it would require tearing
down the whole workspace, while a settings.json edit only requires
restarting the claude agents themselves.

Five sign-in paths:

1. Subscription (primary): `claude auth login --claudeai` is driven via
   pexpect. The CLI prints an `oauth/authorize` URL, the user approves in
   the browser and pastes the shown code (the CLI can also complete on its
   own via its polling). The credential is stored by the CLI itself and
   running claudes re-read it on their next API call, so a fresh workspace
   signs in with NO restart. Managed settings-env keys outrank this
   credential, so when any are active the sign-in clears them and restarts
   the agents (the switching case).
2. Raw API key: written as ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` into the settings env.
3. Imbue (LiteLLM): an env-var-style blob pasted from the desktop app's
   mint page, written as ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` + ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``.
4. Long-lived token: `claude setup-token` via the same PTY machinery; the
   minted 1-year token is written as ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN``.
5. Anthropic Console: `claude auth login --console`; its key lands inside
   `.claude.json` (cached at claude process start), so it always clears
   the managed keys and restarts the agents.

Paths 2 and 3 (and a subtle "paste an existing token" affordance) share one
strict env-lines parser: only the three managed keys are accepted, and
mixed-mode pastes (an OAuth token alongside an API key) are rejected so the
written state is always unambiguous. The writer fully controls the managed
keys -- switching modes deletes the other mode's keys.

Every successful write restarts the mind's claude-binary agents (every
claude-parented type: ``claude``, ``chat``, and ``worker``; the ``main``
services agent is excluded -- its window 0 never runs a live claude, and
restarting it would tear down supervisord and every background service).
Settings-env values are read at claude process start, so a restart is what
makes new credentials take effect. Agent states are snapshotted (via
``mngr list``) before stopping:
agents that were RUNNING mid-task get a "please continue" message after the
restart so unattended workers resume instead of silently dying; WAITING
agents need nothing (their next user message starts them with the fresh
env); STOPPED agents are left stopped.

Besides the settings env block, an apply that writes an
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` also records the key's approval in the shared
`.claude.json` (``customApiKeyResponses.approved``): interactive claude
challenges any unapproved key it sees in env -- settings-env keys
included -- with a TUI dialog that would deadlock the restarted agent
(mngr's claude plugin records approvals at agent-creation time only, and
these keys arrive later). The other startup dialog dismissals in
`.claude.json` are guaranteed by mngr's claude plugin at agent-creation
time. There is deliberately no pre-restart credential probe: a bad
credential surfaces on the agent's first request, where the transcript
auth-error detection reopens the modal.

Dependencies that touch the outside world (subprocess invocation and
pexpect-driven PTY spawning) are injected into `ClaudeAuthService` at
construction so tests can substitute deterministic fakes without
`unittest.mock` or module-level monkeypatching.

        Snapshots agent states first, then issues one batched call per
        behavior group: previously-RUNNING agents restart with
        `--resume-message` so the auth-aware continue message is delivered
        by mngr's readiness-aware resume machinery, and previously-WAITING
        agents restart with `--no-resume` so they come back idle. STOPPED
        agents are left stopped. (The API-key challenge the restarted
        claudes would otherwise hit is pre-empted by the approval the apply
        records; see ``record_api_key_approval``.)

        ``never_welcomed_agent_name`` names the initial chat agent when it
        has never rendered the welcome: it restarts idle even if it
        snapshots as RUNNING. Its only turn is typically the failed
        pre-auth ``/welcome``, whose API-error ending fires no Stop hook
        and strands the ``active`` marker, so the snapshot says RUNNING
        while the agent sits at an idle prompt -- and a "please continue"
        resume message would send a fresh agent hunting for nonexistent
        work. The post-restart welcome resend is its real resumption.
