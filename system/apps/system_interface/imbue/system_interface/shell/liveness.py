"""Liveness probes behind ``AppInventoryEntry.is_running`` (see ``shell/data_types.py``).

The registry row is an app's identity; whether it is running is derived state,
never stored. A row carrying a ``program`` (see ``forward_port.py --program``)
is supervised, so supervisord's own process state -- read over the same RPC
socket ``supervisorctl`` uses -- is the authority. A row without one is managed
outside the workspace, so the best available signal is whether anything answers
a TCP connect on the row's registered URL.
