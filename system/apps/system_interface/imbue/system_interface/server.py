# The ``mngr`` invocation the placeholder offers for standing up an agent to
# repair the workspace. It mirrors what the chat app's ``_build_chat_create_command``
# runs for a chat -- ``--template chat`` for the shared work directory, the output
# style, and running in the workspace tree rather than a worktree of it, plus the
# ``user_created`` label that puts the agent in the dynamic chat memory band.
# Where it differs from that builder:
#
# No ``--type``, which is the one thing that builder cannot leave out: it is
# serving a menu entry, so the harness is a choice the user already made. This
# page has no such choice to carry, so leaving the flag off lets ``mngr`` resolve
# the harness from ``[commands.create] type`` -- whatever this workspace is
# configured to open chats as, rather than whatever it was when this string was
# written. ``--template chat`` supplies the rest either way: it is harness-
# agnostic (``output_style`` is honored by the claude, codex and pi plugins
# alike), so it does not pick one and must not be relied on to.
#
# No ``--transfer none`` either, for a different reason: the ``chat`` template
# already sets it, and the builder spells it out only because it is assembling
# an argv rather than a line for a reader. It is not optional the way the harness
# is -- an agent in a worktree would repair a copy of the workspace instead of
# the workspace -- so ``test_chat_system.py`` reads the template and fails if that
# setting ever leaves it, rather than trusting this comment.
#
# ``--connect`` instead of its ``--no-connect``, which exists to keep a headless
# caller from attaching. Someone typing this wants the opposite, and connecting
# is what turns the create into a conversation. Not merely explicit for the
# reader's sake: the workspace's own ``[commands.create] connect = false`` is
# the default this overrides.
#
# ``--message`` so the agent opens already knowing what the reader is looking at.
# It quotes the page's own heading, which is the one detail a reader on this page
# can be certain of and the one the agent can act on without being told anything
# else.
#
# No name, so mngr mints one. A reload, a second tab, or a first attempt that did
# not finish therefore starts a fresh conversation rather than rejoining an
# earlier one.
#
# Written as the shell line a reader sees and copies, because that string is the
# artifact; the argv is derived from it by the same parse a shell performs, so
# what is offered cannot drift from what runs. Quoted with ``"`` rather than as
# ``shlex.join`` would (``'i'"'"'m ...``): the message carries apostrophes, and
# this is the one line on the page a reader has to be able to read in full.
#
# Kept in sync with that builder by ``test_chat_system.py``, which also validates it
# against the live CLI. It is a suggestion, not a dispatch: the server never
# runs it, so an agent is created only if the reader decides to.

# tabs are tmux sessions, so a reader who runs this in one gets a created agent and
# an error instead of a conversation. Dropping ``TMUX`` for this one command is

# Served in place of the app whenever the compiled bundle is missing. The bundle
# is gitignored build output, so a code refresh that replaces the tree can leave
# the workspace here. The page offers a way out and returns to the interface on
# its own once there is one, so a bundle restored by anything else -- most often
# the reveal flow's rollback -- brings the reader back without them having to
# know to retry.
#
# The way out is a terminal, not a "rebuild" button. A button has to be right
# about what went wrong; the states that strand a workspace here are dominated
# by ones where a build dispatched from the server would fail too (no registry,
# no memory, a lockfile that does not resolve), and it would fail with nowhere
# to say so, on a page with no application to render the failure. It would also
# inherit the server's memory band, which puts it ahead of the user's chats and
# agents in a shed. A shell is the general case of every repair rather than one
# of them, and the terminal app is already running and already *more* protected
# than this server, so the page is pointing at something that outlives it
# rather than starting anything.
#
# Nothing here is part of the compiled bundle -- this is a string in the
# backend -- so the script below ships whether or not the frontend has ever
# been built. That is what lets the page be more than static text in exactly
# the state where the frontend is missing.
