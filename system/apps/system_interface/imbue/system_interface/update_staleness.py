"""Detect when the served tree has moved under this running server.

An update lands by advancing the working tree; the running server only becomes
consistent with it once it restarts into the merged code. The atomic update
apply does both in one motion, but two states can still leave a live process
serving old code over new on-disk state: an apply interrupted mid-motion (its
marker is still present), and a tree that advanced without an activation (an
emergency-path apply, or a hand merge outside the flow). Both are exactly the
skew the geebspace incident grew from, so the server says so instead of
serving silently: it records the tree HEAD it started from, and the app shell
gets a meta tag whenever the live tree no longer
matches -- an informational banner for the user; acting on it stays with the
agent.

"No longer matches" is judged by *what this process runs*, not by raw HEAD
equality. The workspace repo moves for plenty of reasons that leave this
server perfectly current -- minds commit their ordinary work here constantly,
the apply's own version-history commit lands after the restart, and a
frontend-only apply rebuilds the served bundle without restarting -- so a bare
HEAD comparison would show the banner near-permanently and erode the trust the
real one needs. The moved-tree check therefore diffs the startup HEAD against
the current one and reports staleness only when a changed path is one this
process holds in memory or resolves its environment from (see
:func:`_is_path_relevant_to_this_server`).
