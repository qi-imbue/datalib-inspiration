"""Re-tag chat agents' memory-shedding priority from live workspace activity.

The launch wrapper tags every agent's ``oom_score_adj`` once at startup (see
``system/services/oom_priority``). This engine keeps *chat* agents' scores current as the
user engages with them: the more a chat is engaged with, the more protected it is
from an out-of-memory shed. Three signals feed it, all reported by the frontend
through the single ``/api/activity`` endpoint:

- **open** -- the chat has a tab open in the workspace UI,
- **visible** -- the chat's tab is currently visible (implies open),
- **messaged** -- a message was just sent to the chat (drives a recency ranking
  across all chats, newest-first).

Only chat agents are managed. Workers and the primary (services) agent are
excluded by the caller's ``list_chat_agent_ids`` (they keep their launch bands --
workers stay maximally expendable, the primary stays pinned), so opening,
switching to, or messaging one of them never moves its score. A chat with no live
process (dormant, revives on its next message) is simply skipped until its
process exists.

Re-tagging is purely event-driven: ``reapply`` runs on every ``/api/activity``
report and nowhere else. No periodic re-tag is needed because a chat *launches*
at the most-expendable band (see ``oom_priority.bands``) and is only ever
*protected* by a reported engagement -- so a chat that is never reported (dormant,
or messaged outside the UI) safely stays maximally expendable rather than
over-protected. The messaged-revive path is race-free without a poll: the send
blocks until the revived process is ready (and the launch wrapper registers its
pid before that), and the frontend reports activity only after the send returns,
so ``reapply``'s pid lookup finds the live process.

The band arithmetic lives in ``oom_priority.bands`` (the stdlib-only, testable
policy); this engine only holds the activity state and drives the writes. All
collaborators are injected so the engine is unit-testable without ``/proc``, the
agent manager, or the pid registry.
