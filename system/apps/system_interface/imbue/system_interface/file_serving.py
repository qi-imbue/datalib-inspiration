"""Serve agent-authored files referenced by their absolute on-disk path.

An agent (Claude Code) running in this container can write files and read them
back, but the browser rendering the chat cannot reach the container's
filesystem. Markdown like ``![chart](/home/user/workspace/data/images/chart.png)``
(an inline image) or ``[report](/home/user/workspace/data/documents/report.pdf)`` (a
download link) makes the browser issue an HTTP GET for that path; the system
interface runs in the same container as the agent, so it answers the GET by
streaming the file's bytes. The absolute on-disk path therefore doubles as the
URL -- no rewriting, no dedicated directory, no separate server.

This hangs off the single-page-app catch-all (see ``server._index_catch_all``):

- An image file is served inline so it renders in the chat.
- Any other existing file is served as an attachment, so a plain markdown link
  downloads it rather than rendering/executing it in the chat's own origin.
- A path carrying an image extension with no file behind it 404s, so a typo'd
  image renders a broken image rather than the app shell.
- A path that matches no file on disk returns ``None``, so the caller falls
  through to the app shell and client-side routing is unaffected.
