"""Project-specific ratchets confining postMessage to the sanctioned boundaries.

Cross-frame messaging flows through exactly four files, each owning one
boundary: messaging with the embedding minds chrome goes through the
vendored embed contract (imported via the library's ``embed.ts``; see minds'
``docs/embed-contract.md``), the shell's side of every message crossing to
or from the frames it created (the minds relay of the workspace app model's
contracts section 11 and the ``shell:`` messages of its section 10, the
location beacons included) goes through ``src/relay.ts``, an app page's side
of that contract goes through the library's ``app_contract.ts`` (the module
the shell serves to every app), and the focus grant the shell sends a framed
page goes through the library's ``terminalFocus.ts`` (outbound-only, one
fixed payload-free message, no listener; see its docstring). These ratchets are allowlist-by-file: any NEW file that touches
``postMessage`` or registers a ``message`` listener fails immediately,
keeping the whole message surface greppable and auditable file by file.
Lives outside ``test_ratchets.py`` because that file must define the same
test set across every project (enforced by ``test_meta_ratchets.py``).

The boundary modules live in the shared library (``system/libs/workspace_ui``),
which the shell's bundle compiles in, so its sources are walked too. The chat
page is the chat app's own frontend (``system/apps/chat/frontend``), an app page
like any other: the shell's bundle imports nothing of it.
