/**
 * message-kinds.ts -- THE enumeration of how every `user_message` in an agent
 * transcript is displayed, and the single source of truth a NEW HARNESS reads to
 * know what it must produce.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCOPE: this catalogues ONLY the `user_message` event channel -- the transcript
 * slot that is OVERLOADED (a genuine human turn AND framework/system injections
 * all share it), and so needs disambiguating. Assistant-side surfaces
 * (tool-call blocks, tk step nodes, sub-agent cards, permission cards, plain
 * prose) are NOT user_messages, are not overloaded, and render through their own
 * dedicated paths (see message-renderers.ts + the event types in Response.ts).
 * They are not "kinds" and are untouched by this module.
 *
 * The transcript stream reuses the `user_message` event for several things that
 * are NOT a human typing: a Stop hook firing, a skill being expanded, the browser
 * fleet telling a queued agent its browser is free, a background-task completion
 * notice, etc. Left undistinguished, each of those renders as a bare user bubble,
 * as if the person had said it.
 *
 * Classification used to be scattered across the grouping and rendering layers as
 * ad-hoc string predicates, and each layer independently decided placement AND
 * appearance -- so "does this open a new turn" and "does this look like a chip"
 * were tangled into one function and drifted apart. This module untangles them:
 *
 *   1. A `UserMessageKind` names ONE type of display (not one source). Several
 *      sources can map to the same kind -- a Stop hook, a fleet notice, and a
 *      task notification are all the SAME display (a collapsed system chip) and
 *      so are all `UserMessageKind.SystemChip`, differing only by their chip label.
 *   2. `KIND_SPEC` records, per kind, exactly how it renders: which rail, whether
 *      it opens a new turn, and a prose description of the net visual. Read it to
 *      answer "what will my message look like?" without tracing render code.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Adding a harness (Codex, etc.)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The `UserMessageKind`s below are harness-AGNOSTIC -- they are display buckets, not
 * Claude-specific markers. A new harness does NOT add kinds; it adds a detector
 * that maps ITS framework markers to these existing kinds (see
 * `classifyUserMessage` in message-classification.ts, which holds Claude Code's
 * detector table). At a glance, a harness author needs to answer, for each kind:
 * "does my framework emit a message that should display this way, and if so how
 * do I recognise it?" If a harness has no equivalent (e.g. no Stop hook), that
 * kind simply never occurs for it -- nothing downstream needs to change.
 *
 * Nothing in the grouping or rendering layers is harness-specific: they consume
 * `UserMessageKind` only.
