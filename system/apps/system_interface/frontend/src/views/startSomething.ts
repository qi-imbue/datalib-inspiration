/**
 * "Start something": the ways INTO the product the New Tab page offers as tiles, each a title, a
 * sentence, a glyph, and the first message of the chat it starts. Where "Open new" spins up an
 * empty object, these name an intent; the prompts are plain-language requests written so the
 * mind's own skills match on them, and name no skill.
 *
 * One tile is the exception: "Start from a template" has its answer further down the same page,
 * so it scrolls there instead of opening anything (``prompt`` is null).
 *
 * Each tile has a hue from the Minds brand palette (the sheet the workspace accents come from).
 * The tile itself stays a white card; the hue shows in the glyph, drawn duotone off it: the hue
 * darkened for the stroke, a wash of it for the fill of whatever shapes the glyph closes.
 *
 * The grid shows START_PAGE_SIZE tiles at a time; "See more" reveals the next page and stays
 * until every tile is shown. The paging arithmetic and the search match are pure and tested.
