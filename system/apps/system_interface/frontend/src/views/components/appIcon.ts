/**
 * An app's own icon, made safe to inline, and the fallback rule for apps
 * without one.
 *
 * An app registers its icon as SVG markup (`forward_port.py --icon`), the
 * registry carries it verbatim on the app's row, and the server hands it to
 * this UI on `AppEntry.icon`. That markup is authored by a skill, so it is
 * untrusted: every surface that draws an app goes through
 * `appIconMarkup`/`appIconMarkupByName` here, and nothing inlines a registry
 * string on its own.
 *
 * The gate is `sanitizeIconMarkup`, and it is deliberately the only one:
 *
 * - Parsing is DOMPurify's, not ours. Hand-rolling HTML validation is how
 *   mutation-XSS gets in; DOMPurify parses the markup with the browser's own
 *   parser and keeps only an SVG allowlist.
 * - Anything that can execute or reach off the page is refused rather than
 *   repaired at the edges: elements that run code, navigate, load a resource,
 *   embed foreign HTML, or retarget an attribute at runtime, `<style>` and
 *   `style=` (CSS can fetch), `on*` handlers, and any URI that is not a
 *   `#fragment` inside the icon itself.
 * - `class` goes too. With no stylesheet of its own an icon's classes can only
 *   match the workspace's, which is a way to borrow layout rules rather than a
 *   way to draw.
 * - The result must be exactly one `<svg>` element. Two roots, a text node
 *   beside the root, or anything that is not an `<svg>` is not an icon, and is
 *   rejected whole -- the caller then draws its built-in glyph.
 *
 * This is defense in depth, not the only defense: `forward_port.py` validates
 * on the way into the registry. This gate is the last one because it is the
 * one that runs against the DOM the markup is about to enter.
 *
 * Sizing and color live here too, since both are decided from the same parsed
 * tree. The icon is rendered at the caller's pixel size on the caller's own
 * grid (its `viewBox` is kept, or derived from its width/height, so the art
 * scales rather than crops), and an icon that names no root `fill` inherits
 * `currentColor` the way the built-in glyphs do -- while one that paints
 * itself keeps every color it asked for.
