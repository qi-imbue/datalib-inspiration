 * What varies **by instance** (whether it can be renamed, deleted, stopped and started on its
 * own, whether its app can be stopped) is read off the inventory records here. What varies **by caller** -- what running
 * a verb actually does -- is not: the tab acts on a live, open panel (Close tab), while the
 * rail can be showing an instance with no open panel at all (Remove from project).
 * ``TabMenuActions`` is the seam: every verb's behavior is a callback the caller supplies,
 * and ``tabMenuEntries`` only decides which of those gets wrapped into a row, in what order.

 * their app renames), Close tab drops the panel, Remove from project drops the filing, Stop
 * drops what backs the instance (or, for a single-instance app, the app's process), Delete
 * drops the instance.
 *
 * Delete is offered only for an instance of an app that has instances: a single-instance app
 * IS its one record, and the record goes only when the app is unregistered. Stop and Start
 * of the instance are offered where its app reports it ``stoppable`` (a chat's agent, a
 * browser's Chromium, a terminal's session) and the app is running to take the verb (while
 * it is down, every instance reads ``stopped`` and only the app itself can be started), and
 * read from the instance's status. Stop and Start of the whole app are offered only on a
 * single-instance app's tab, where the two coincide, and only for an app the workspace can
 * honestly stop (supervised, not critical, and not inside a critical app's program); a
 * multi-instance app is stopped from the rail's row menu.
