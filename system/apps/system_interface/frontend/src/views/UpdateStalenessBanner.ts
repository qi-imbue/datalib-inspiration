/**
 * Informational banner shown when the workspace's on-disk code has moved
 * under the running interface.
 *
 * The backend injects <meta name="system-interface-update-staleness"> into the
 * app shell (see update_staleness.py) with one of three variants: a failed
 * update's rollback could not restore a healthy workspace, an update apply was
 * interrupted mid-motion (its marker is still present), or the tree advanced
 * without this server restarting into it. All mean the page the user is
 * reading may not match the workspace's current code. The banner only informs
 * -- acting on it stays with the agent, so the copy points the user there
 * rather than offering an action surface. Dismissal is per page load: a reload
 * after the state resolves gets a shell with no tag at all.
