/**
 * The live pages, and which pane is showing each one.
 *
 * There is ONE live page per instance, machine-wide: an instance open in three projects is
 * one iframe and one document, not three. A project is a *view* that may or may not include
 * the instance, and a pane is only a place to show it at some size. Removing an iframe from
 * the document destroys it, and re-parenting one reloads it, so the element holding a page
 * must never leave the DOM -- not on a view switch, not on a tab close, not on a re-arrange.
 * The instance leaving its app's list is the one thing that takes it out.
 *
 * So this registry is global and keyed by the instance's address, and a dockview panel is
 * demoted to a **slot**: an empty div that dockview creates, positions, hides and disposes at
 * will. A surface lives in the same layer dockview positions its own panel overlays in,
 * mirrors the geometry and visibility of whichever slot currently shows it, and outlives
 * every one of them.
 *
 * DockviewWorkspace owns everything that knows what a page *is* -- which url it loads, what it
 * is called, what filing it means. This module owns only where the live elements are, how
 * big, and whether anything is looking at them.
