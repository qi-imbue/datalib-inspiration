/**
 * The projects: the shell's REST routes for them (contracts.md section 6) and the pure rules
 * the views apply over them.
 *
 * A project is a **view**: a shared tab set (the addresses it shows) plus each client's own
 * arrangement of it, and a rail of shortcuts. The tab set is many-to-many: the same instance
 * can sit in any number of projects, and nothing owns anything. Opening an instance in a project
 * files it there; closing a tab changes nothing; the rail's "Remove from project" unfiles an
 * address from one project; and an address leaves every tab set when its app stops listing it.
 *
 * "Everything" is the view with no filter and the home: every instance on the machine is in it.
 * It has an arrangement per client like any other view but no registry entry -- it never comes
 * back from `fetchProjectsList`, has no tab set of its own, and cannot be renamed or deleted.
