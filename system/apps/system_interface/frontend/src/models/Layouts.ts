/**
 * Client layouts: one arrangement per view per client, read and written through the shell's

 *
 * A layout is the serialized dockview grid, and nothing beside it: what each panel shows lives in
 * the ``params`` dockview keeps on the panel (``PanelParams`` below), so there is no second copy
 * of a tab's identity to fall out of step with the grid. The client's layout file on the shell
 * is the truth of the arrangement: this window writes it for the user's own gestures, the shell
 * writes it for agent ops, and every write is announced as ``layout_updated`` so the client's
 * other windows refetch. Each save carries a save id this window minted (so it can skip the echo
 * of its own writes) and the stamp of the arrangement it was based on (so a save over a newer
 * arrangement is refused rather than clobbering it).
