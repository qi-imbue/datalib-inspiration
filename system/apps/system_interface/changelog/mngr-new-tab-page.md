The New Tab page is redesigned around starting things, after the `minds-new-tab` prototype (`docs/system/blueprint/new-tab-page/plan-new-tab-page.md`).

- A search field leads the page. Typing swaps the sections for results: the machine's instances and "Open new" actions that match, the matching "Start something" tiles, and the matching templates, each shown only when it has matches.

- "Open new" lays its tiles out four to a row, each a quarter of the row wide: the apps whose manifests declare a `launcher_rank`, lowest first (the built-ins: chat, file viewer, browser, terminal), then every other app, wrapping onto further rows.

- "In this project" is shown only when the project holds something; "On this machine" is no longer on a project's resting page and is reached through the search field. The Everything view keeps its machine-wide table.

- "Start something": six intent tiles (build an app, start from a template, connect your data, set up a routine, delegate a task, make sense of a pile of stuff), each starting a new chat seeded with a plain-language prompt, except "Start from a template", which scrolls the page to the templates section (also from search results) and is disabled when no catalog is configured; "See more" reveals the next page of tiles ("Learn about Minds" and "Edit Minds itself"). Each tile's glyph is drawn duotone in a Minds brand-palette hue, as in the prototype. The prompt goes to whichever app declares an action with a `message` param, so the shell still names no app.

- "Start from a template": the published-template catalog by category, each category a sideways rail of cards with paging arrows (each a full-height strip at the rail's end that fades the rail out under it, so the whole edge is the target), followed by an "All templates" row. A card opens a detail dialog (the drawing, the write-up, what it needs, the repository) whose "Make it mine" starts a chat that adopts the template with `/use-template`, and whose other action asks for a new machine made from it (both stand down, like the prompt tiles, when no app takes a first message or the pane is already starting something).

- The catalog is fetched by the shell from `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_TEMPLATE_CATALOG_URL` (a versioned JSON document, see `catalog/README.md`), reused for six hours, kept as a last good copy under `data/.state/system_interface/template_catalog.json`, and served at `GET /api/templates-catalog`. The page says "Loading templates..." until it arrives and "Failed to load templates." when nothing could be loaded; with no URL configured the section is omitted.

- The shell's `apps_updated` message and inventory document carry each app's `launcher_rank` and each action's `params` (the names), read off the registry.

- A shell state file write that fails because a regular file sits where its directory should be now raises the documented `ShellStateError` (the temp-file cleanup no longer replaces it with a bare `NotADirectoryError`).
