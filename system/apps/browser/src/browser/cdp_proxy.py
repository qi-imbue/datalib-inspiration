"""The agent's gated CDP endpoint.

Agents do not get Chromium's real debug port; they get `ws://127.0.0.1:<proxy>/<name>/<token>`.
Everything an agent sends passes through `_forward`, which is where the ownership lease is
enforced -- the role `LiveBrowser.run_action()`'s compare-and-set played when the fleet owned
the driving verbs.

Two design points are load-bearing and were settled by measurement, not reasoning:

* **Refuse frames; never close the socket.** A `@playwright/cli` slug is poisoned the moment
  its socket drops: it never rebinds, and `playwright-cli list` stops showing it. Refusing
  individual frames was measured to leave the session healthy -- the same slug drove normally
  again as soon as the lease came back.
* **Serve discovery on both the bare and trailing-slash paths.** Playwright fetches
  `/json/version/`; a proxy that routes only `/json/version` fails the attach with
  `Unexpected status 404` and the CLI daemon exits.

This is a guardrail, not a security boundary. The agent has a shell and can read
`DevToolsActivePort` out of the profile directory, so the block list is sized for what the
CLI actually sends rather than for a hostile client.
