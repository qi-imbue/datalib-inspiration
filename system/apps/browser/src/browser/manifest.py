"""The browser-fleet persistence manifest: the one thing we serialize by hand.

It records the durable *topology* of the fleet -- which browser names exist and the
tab URLs each had -- so the daemon can relaunch them on the next container start.
It deliberately stores NO ownership/queue state (that is connection/process-scoped
and dies with the old container) and NO Chromium profile bytes (cookies/logins/
history live in each browser's persistent ``user_data_dir`` on the workspace volume;
see ``session.py``). Because it's tiny JSON it can live under ``runtime/`` and ride
the opt-in GitHub sync, so even a full container rebuild restores the tab list.

Pure synchronous file IO (no asyncio here, on purpose): writes are atomic via a
temp file + ``os.replace`` so a reader on the next boot sees either the old or the
new complete file, never a torn one.
