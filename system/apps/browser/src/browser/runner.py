"""Live-browser fleet web service: spawn headless Chromium, stream it, drive it with browser-use.

Reached through the system_interface proxy at ``/service/browser/``. Serves one
self-contained viewer page (assets/index.html) that renders a streamed browser
and an "Agent has control" overlay; the page talks back over one WebSocket,
``/browsers/{name}/cast`` (screencast frames out; human input, tab control, and
take/return-control in). Browsers are addressed by NAME (a random ~2-word english
name like ``alex-smith``), not a sequential int; there is no default browser.

Agents drive the fleet over HTTP (see the ``agentic-browser-fleet`` CLI):

* ``GET  /browsers``            -- list every browser, its owner, and its tabs.
* ``POST /browsers``            -- start a new browser (body ``{"name": ...}`` optional;
  returns ``{"name": ...}``). 400 invalid name, 409 duplicate name or fleet full.
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/task``  -- acquire-or-wait, run a browser-use task, stream
  the thinking/action trace as line-delimited JSON, release on completion.
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/hold``  -- acquire-or-wait and hold the browser until the
  request disconnects (the ``lock`` verb); release on disconnect.
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/release`` -- give a browser back (only its owner can).

For ``task`` and ``hold`` the request connection IS the lease: if it drops, the
run is cancelled and the browser is released.

ARCHITECTURE: this is a synchronous Flask + flask-sock service (thread-per-
connection, served by a threaded Werkzeug HTTP/1.1 server). browser_use,
Playwright (async), and the per-browser ownership state machine in session.py
are all async and run on ONE background asyncio event loop, quarantined behind a
single :class:`~browser.loop_bridge.AsyncLoopBridge`. Every route handler reaches
the async world only through ``bridge.run(coro)`` (blocking) or ``bridge.submit``
(fire-and-forget, returns the in-loop asyncio.Task). This mirrors the proven
Flask+WS pattern in system/apps/system_interface. ``ROOT_PATH`` is read for informational
parity but is no longer wired into URL generation: the viewer uses relative URLs,
so the ``/service/browser/`` proxy prefix needs no server-side awareness (the
FastAPI ``root_path`` it replaced only emitted prefix-aware URLs the page never
relied on).
