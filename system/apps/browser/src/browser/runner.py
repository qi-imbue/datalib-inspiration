"""Live-browser fleet web service: spawn headful Chromium, stream it, hand agents gated CDP.

Served at its own workspace origin (``browser.host-<hex>.localhost`` locally;
share hostnames follow the same prefix rule). Serves one
self-contained viewer page (assets/index.html) that renders a streamed browser
and an "Agent has control" overlay. The page talks over two WebSockets: the media
plane ``/browsers/{name}/stream`` (pixelflux H.264 pixels + Opus audio out; XTEST
input, resize, and attention (interact/hidden) in) and the control plane ``/browsers/{name}/cast``
(control/ownership state out; take/return-control in). Browsers are addressed by NAME
(a random ~2-word english name like ``alex-smith``), not a sequential int; there is
no default browser.

Agents drive the fleet over HTTP (see the ``agentic-browser-fleet`` CLI):

* ``GET  /browsers``            -- list every browser, its owner, and its tabs.
* ``POST /browsers``            -- start a new browser (body ``{"name": ...}`` optional;
  returns ``{"name": ...}``). 400 invalid name, 409 duplicate name or fleet full.
* ``GET  /browsers/{name}/attach`` -- the gated CDP URL to point `playwright-cli` at.
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/acquire`` -- reserve a browser (and get the exit code an agent
  branches on; see ``fleet._render_action``).
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/release`` -- give a browser back (only its owner can).
* ``POST /browsers/{name}/stop`` / ``.../start`` -- end a browser's Chromium while keeping the
  browser, its profile, and its tabs; relaunch it on them (the viewer's Start button).

The workspace shell reads the same fleet through the instances API of the workspace app
model (``/_instances``; see ``browser.instances``), mounted on this app because the
daemon serves its own origin: one instance per browser, ``working`` while an agent holds
it, ``idle`` otherwise, ``error`` once crashed; ``new`` creates, delete closes, location
navigates the active tab. Every fleet event nudges the shell through the nudger the manager
in ``browser.session`` holds.

The service does NOT drive browsers. Agents drive with ``@playwright/cli`` over the
gated CDP endpoint in cdp_proxy.py, which enforces the ownership lease per frame.

ARCHITECTURE: this is a synchronous Flask + flask-sock service (thread-per-
connection, served by a threaded Werkzeug HTTP/1.1 server). The CDP client, the CDP
proxy, and the per-browser ownership state machine in session.py are all async and
run on ONE background asyncio event loop, quarantined behind a
single :class:`~browser.loop_bridge.AsyncLoopBridge`. Every route handler reaches
the async world only through ``bridge.run(coro)`` (blocking) or ``bridge.submit``
(fire-and-forget, returns the in-loop asyncio.Task). This mirrors the proven
Flask+WS pattern in system/apps/system_interface. The service owns its origin, so
the viewer's relative URLs need no prefix or root-path awareness anywhere.
