"""Tiny threaded HTTP/1.1 Werkzeug server, copied from system/apps/system_interface.

Copied verbatim (not imported) because ``system/apps/browser`` must not depend on an
app. The browser daemon serves Flask + flask-sock over a thread-per-connection
server: every long-lived NDJSON stream and every cast WebSocket owns its own OS
thread, which is what flask-sock needs and what replaces uvicorn's single
asyncio event loop. HTTP/1.1 (vs werkzeug's HTTP/1.0 default) is required for
keepalive and the incremental flush of the streamed ``task``/``hold`` responses.
