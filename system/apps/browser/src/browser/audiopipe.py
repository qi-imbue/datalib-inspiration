"""On-demand Opus audio for the streamed browser (pcmflux).

pcmflux is linuxserver's audio sibling of pixelflux (same vendor, same wheel
family) -- it captures a PulseAudio source with ``pa_simple``, Opus-encodes on
a native thread, and invokes a Python callback per encoded chunk, exactly the
shape ``videopipe`` already uses.

Only-when-playing, for free: pcmflux's ``use_silence_gate`` compares each 20ms
frame against digital zero and skips both the encode and the callback when the
tab is silent. A silent browser therefore costs zero encode CPU and zero bytes
on the wire; the only residual is pcmflux reading zeros off the null sink's
monitor (a sub-1%-of-a-core memcpy). No pactl-subscribe process, no ffmpeg, no
relay -- the gate is sample-accurate, so it also catches the common case of a
site holding an uncorked-but-silent audio stream.

Tuned for minimum server CPU: mono, 48 kbps Opus VBR. Opus stays clean at that
rate (far better than MP2 128k) while the encode is a low-single-digit % of one
core, and only while sound actually plays. Override the bitrate with
``BROWSER_AUDIO_BITRATE`` if a session needs richer audio.

Chunks ride the SAME ``/stream`` WebSocket as video, interleaved by a leading
magic byte 0x01 (video packets lead with 0x04); the raw Opus payload follows.
They never touch the video credit window and are dropped, never queued, when
the link stalls -- audio staleness self-bounds at the client's jitter buffer.
