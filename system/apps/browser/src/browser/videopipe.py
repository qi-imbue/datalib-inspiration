"""Pixelflux H.264 stripe pipe with per-row credit-ack flow control.

Pixelflux (the Rust capture/encode engine behind Selkies) watches the session's
private X display and encodes damage-driven H.264 on the
CPU -- in STRIPE mode: the frame splits into min(cores, height/64) horizontal
stripes, each with its own change detection and its own encoder, so only
changed rows are encoded (in parallel) and an idle screen costs nothing. Each
stripe row is an independent H.264 stream the viewer decodes with its own
VideoDecoder and composites at its y-offset (the Selkies client's design).

Flow control is per row and it is NOT socket backpressure: the delivery chain
crosses several hops (gVisor netstack, sshd -- whose per-channel window alone
is 2 MB -- a tunnel, a local forwarder) whose buffers swallow writes long
after the path is congested. The viewer acks every stripe as it leaves its
decoder (``ack,<frame_id>,<y_start>``) and each row never has more than
``_CREDIT_LIMIT`` unacknowledged stripes outstanding, so bytes in flight are
bounded everywhere no matter where congestion lives; a degraded path yields
fewer, fresher stripes instead of an ever-older backlog. Undelivered stripes
are replaced newest-wins per row (staleness is bounded at ~1 frame); dropping
a delta breaks that row's decode chain, so the row discards deltas until the
(rate limited, global) IDR request produces a keyframe.

The cursor never touches the framebuffer: pixelflux delivers shape changes
out-of-band (XFixes) as ``(type, png, hot_x, hot_y)`` and the pipe queues them
for the sender as ``cursor,<hot_x>,<hot_y>,<png base64>`` text frames; the
viewer applies them as its CSS cursor at the LOCAL pointer position. Pointer
motion therefore costs zero encode.

Wire format: pixelflux's own stripe header, verified against
``pixelflux/src/encoders/software.rs`` (encode_with_headers)::

    byte 0     0x04 (H.264 magic)
    byte 1     frame type: 0x01 IDR, 0x02 non-IDR intra, 0x00 delta
    bytes 2-3  frame counter, u16 big-endian (wraps)
    bytes 4-5  stripe y-start, u16 big-endian
    bytes 6-9  stripe width / height, u16 big-endian each
    bytes 10+  Annex B payload

Headers pass through to the viewer untouched; (frame id, y-start) is the ack
token.
