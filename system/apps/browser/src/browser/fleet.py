"""``agentic-browser-fleet``: drive the shared browser fleet from an agent's shell.

This is the CLI the agent calls to OWN a browser -- not to drive one. It is a thin,
stateless HTTP client to the per-workspace browser daemon (runner.py). Driving happens
over ``playwright-cli``, pointed at the gated CDP URL that ``new`` and ``acquire``
print. ``take control`` is a human action in the UI, not something this CLI does.

Ownership rules (enforced by the daemon, surfaced here):

* Each browser is controlled by exactly one party. The lease is sticky: it is acquired
  on first use and auto-released after an idle timeout.
* Agents never preempt each other: ``acquire`` on a browser another agent holds
  waits in a FIFO queue until it is free (``--no-wait`` fails fast instead).
* A browser a human took control of is locked to the human. Resume only when the
  human tells you to ("keep going") -- then, and only then, pass ``--reclaim``.

Browsers are addressed by NAME (numbered ``browser-<N>`` for daemon-minted ones),
not a number. There is no default browser: run ``new`` first (it prints a name),
then drive that browser by its name.

Commands::

    agentic-browser-fleet ls [--include-tabs]
    agentic-browser-fleet new [name]            # prints the `playwright-cli attach --cdp=` line
    agentic-browser-fleet close <name>          # ends the browser; DELETES its profile
    agentic-browser-fleet acquire <name> [--reclaim] [--no-wait] [--max-wait S]
    agentic-browser-fleet release <name>        # alias: unlock
    agentic-browser-fleet handoff <name> "<reason>"   # alias: request-human

Driving is NOT here -- the agent attaches `playwright-cli` to the gated CDP endpoint this
CLI hands out. `playwright-cli --help` is the command reference.

The daemon address is discovered from ``data/.state/apps.toml`` (the same
registry ``layout.py`` reads), overridable via ``MINDS_BROWSER_SERVICE_URL``,
falling back to ``http://127.0.0.1:8081``. Browser panes are pulled into the
agent's view via ``system/scripts/layout.py`` (anchored at ``$BROWSER_FLEET_ANCHOR`` if
set -- a parent passes its chat address to sub-agents -- else the caller's own chat).
