"""Live browser fleet: headless Chromium + CDP screencast + a per-browser ownership state machine.

Each :class:`LiveBrowser` owns one headless Chromium (launched and driven by
``browser_use.BrowserSession``) plus a second, observer-only Playwright
connection over the same CDP endpoint. The Playwright side does the things
browser-use does not: stream the live view to the user (CDP
``Page.startScreencast`` -> base64 JPEG frames over a WebSocket) and inject the
user's mouse/keyboard (CDP ``Input.dispatch*Event``). The browser-use side does
the AI driving (``Agent.run``). Both clients share the one Chromium, so the
human sees exactly what the agent does and vice versa.

Ownership is a small per-browser state machine, and it is the heart of this
module. Many agents (a chat agent plus its sub-agents, each a distinct
``MNGR_AGENT_ID``) share one fleet; any single browser is controlled by exactly
one party at a time: a specific agent, or the human. Every control change goes
through the single writer :meth:`LiveBrowser._write_control_locked`, called only
under ``_control_lock`` with a compare-and-set guard, so there is no bespoke
ordering anywhere and "single asyncio process" actually means atomic. The state:

* ``controller`` -- ``"human"`` or ``"agent"``.
* ``owner_agent_id`` -- which agent holds it (when ``controller == "agent"``).
* ``human_pinned`` -- the human explicitly took control; agents are locked out
  until the human hands back. (Idle ``human`` with ``human_pinned`` false is
  the resting state: human-drivable and agent-acquirable.)

Rules that fall out of this and never need a special case:

* Agents NEVER preempt anyone. :meth:`acquire` succeeds only against an unpinned
  human (or the same agent re-acquiring); against another agent it parks the
  caller in a FIFO wait-queue (monitor-and-wait) until that agent releases.
* The human ALWAYS wins: :meth:`take_control` preempts whatever agent is driving
  (cancelling its run) and pins; a pinned browser evicts any waiters.
* Ownership is bound to the live ``task`` request (see runner.py): if the agent
  process dies, the request disconnects, the run is cancelled, and the browser
  is released -- no fire-and-forget locks, no stuck owners.

The Anthropic API key is read lazily from the environment (and a fresh re-read of
``$MNGR_HOST_DIR/env``) at run time, so a key submitted after this service booted
is still picked up without a restart. Direct Anthropic API key only -- the Imbue
Cloud / litellm proxy (``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``) path is intentionally unsupported.

        fan-out list, so the viewer's first messages are deterministic -- no live
        frame can interleave ahead of the control/tabs the viewer needs first.

    is no default browser and the fleet starts EMPTY. Names are unique within the
