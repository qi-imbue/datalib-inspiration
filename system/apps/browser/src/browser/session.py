"""Live browser fleet: headful Chromium on a private Xvfb, streamed via pixelflux, with a per-browser ownership state machine.

Each :class:`LiveBrowser` owns one headful Chromium on its OWN private Xvfb display,
launched by ``chrome_launcher`` and observed over the fleet's own ``CdpClient``; the
agent drives it through ``cdp_proxy`` with ``@playwright/cli``.

The fleet owns the browser; it does not own the driving. It launches Chromium, holds the
ownership lease, keeps its own CDP channel for the tab list / foregrounding / crash
detection, and hands the agent a gated CDP endpoint. Everything about *how to click a
button* is the CLI's business. The pixel view is streamed by pixelflux capturing the
display's foreground window as damage-driven H.264 (see videopipe.py / mediastream.py);
human input is XTEST at that display (xinput.py). The fleet's one job on top of the
agent's driving is to foreground the tab it is acting on, so pixelflux shows it -- the
human sees exactly what the agent does and vice versa.

Ownership is a small per-browser state machine, and it is the heart of this
module. Many agents (a chat agent plus its sub-agents, each a distinct
``MNGR_AGENT_ID``) share one fleet; any single browser is controlled by exactly
one party at a time: a specific agent, or the human. Every control change goes
through the single writer :meth:`LiveBrowser._write_control_locked`, called only
under ``_control_lock`` with a compare-and-set guard, so there is no bespoke
ordering anywhere and "single asyncio process" actually means atomic. The state:

* ``controller`` -- ``"human"`` or ``"agent"``.
* ``owner_agent_id`` -- which agent holds it (when ``controller == "agent"``).
* ``human_pinned`` -- the human explicitly took control; agents are locked out
  until the human hands back. (Idle ``human`` with ``human_pinned`` false is
  the resting state: human-drivable and agent-acquirable.)

Rules that fall out of this and never need a special case:

* Agents NEVER preempt anyone. :meth:`acquire` succeeds only against an unpinned
  human (or the same agent re-acquiring); against another agent it parks the
  caller in a FIFO wait-queue (monitor-and-wait) until that agent releases.
* The human ALWAYS wins: :meth:`take_control` preempts whatever agent is driving
  (cancelling its run) and pins; a pinned browser evicts any waiters.
* Ownership is bound to the live ``task`` request (see runner.py): if the agent
  process dies, the request disconnects, the run is cancelled, and the browser
  is released -- no fire-and-forget locks, no stuck owners.

The Anthropic API key is read lazily from the environment (and a fresh re-read of
``$MNGR_HOST_DIR/env``) at run time, so a key submitted after this service booted
is still picked up without a restart. Direct Anthropic API key only -- the Imbue
Cloud / litellm proxy (``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``) path is intentionally unsupported.

    :class:`LiveBrowser` in ``init`` under :attr:`_lock` (cap check + name resolution +

    "not-registered-yet" window shrinks to the sub-millisecond gap before the dict insert
    is visible).

    time. This is enforced by :attr:`_startup_lock` (a dedicated asyncio.Lock), which the
    background launch (:meth:`_launch`) holds across the WHOLE (multi-second) launch.
    Multiple ``init`` browsers queue on it and boot back-to-back, never in parallel.
    Registration (under :attr:`_lock`) is decoupled from launching (under
    :attr:`_startup_lock`): the cap counts ``init`` browsers too, so a flood of creates
    can't overshoot even though their launches run later. ``init`` browsers DO count
