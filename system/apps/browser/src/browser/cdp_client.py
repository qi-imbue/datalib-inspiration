"""The fleet's own persistent CDP connection to one Chromium.

Replaces what browser-use's `BrowserSession` provided: the browser-level channel the
fleet needs for its *own* bookkeeping -- listing tabs, foregrounding the tab the pane
films, restoring tabs after a restart, and (§5.1) noticing that Chromium died even when
no agent is attached.

This is deliberately NOT the agent's channel. Agents talk to `cdp_proxy`, which holds its
own upstream socket. Three simultaneous CDP clients on one browser were measured to
coexist without interference, so the fleet keeping a private one is safe.

Reconnect-vs-dead is the subtle part and the reason this class exists rather than a bare
`websockets.connect()`. A transient socket drop that reconnects is NOT a crash; only a
connection that is both down and out of retries is. `alive` encodes that, so the keepalive
loop can keep its two-poll debounce (see `LiveBrowser._keepalive_loop`).
