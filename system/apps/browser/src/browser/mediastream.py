"""Fleet media socket: pixelflux H.264 video to one viewer of one browser.

The pixel path here is the fleet's streaming stack -- the newest-wins credit-ack pipe,
the outbound send loop (control message, out-of-band cursor, stripe packets),
TCP_NODELAY, the permessage-deflate strip, and the 250ms heartbeat the client keys on.
The caller resolves the browser by NAME and hands us its private display (:N), so we
open a capture pipe on THAT display.

The clipboard bridge (XFixes copy-out monitor + xclip paste-in via
:mod:`browser.xclipboard`) is keyed per browser (each has its own display and possibly
several viewers), and paste-IN is GATED on ``session.input_allowed`` so only the
controlling human can write into the browser -- copy-OUT (what's already on the screen
the human is watching) is ungated.

Audio: pcmflux Opus chunks (:mod:`browser.audiopipe`) ride
the SAME ``/stream`` socket as video, interleaved by a leading magic byte and
drained on the single sender thread. The fleet adaptation is that each browser
captures ITS OWN PulseAudio sink monitor (``session.audio_capture_device``), so
split-view browsers don't mix sound. Audio is strictly additive -- if pcmflux or
the sink is unavailable, video streams unchanged.
