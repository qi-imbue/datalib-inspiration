"""Passive, watch-only telemetry for the pixelflux stream (Rung 1: server-side).

The pipe already computes almost everything an engineer needs to see -- per-stripe
send/ack round-trip time, the AIMD's chosen capture rate, the CRF/window servo
state, and the three kinds of frame drop -- and then throws the raw values away.
This module is the "dumb sink": the hot paths ``emit(browser_id, record)`` a small
dict into a per-browser ring, and a separate read-only WebSocket (the firehose,
wired in ``runner``) drains it to a standalone client-side lens that does ALL the
joining, percentiles and drawing. Nothing here is ever read back into a control
decision, so recording cannot change what the pipe does.

Watch-only discipline (the constraint the whole design rests on):

* ``emit`` never takes a lock and never blocks. It reads two atomic references
  (``dict.get`` + an immutable subscriber tuple) and does ``deque.append`` (all
  GIL-atomic), so it can run inside the pipe's ``_condition`` critical sections
  without lengthening them meaningfully and without introducing a new lock that a
  slow lens could back-pressure through.
* The subscriber tuple is swapped wholesale on (un)subscribe under ``_lock`` -- a
  rare event -- so ``emit`` iterating it is always safe (it sees the old or the new
  tuple, both valid) and never contends that lock.
* Every record carries a per-browser ``seq``; a gap the lens sees means the ring
  overflowed and it MISSED data -- the tool admits its own blind spots rather than
  drawing a clean-but-false picture.
* ``emit`` swallows everything: a telemetry bug must never take down the stream.

Volume is tiny (this host has 2 cores -> pixelflux runs 2 stripe rows -> ~360
records/s), so a per-browser history ring plus per-subscriber queues costs a few MB
and no measurable CPU.
