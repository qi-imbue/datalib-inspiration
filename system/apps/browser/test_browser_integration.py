"""Integration tests for the browser fleet.

Three kinds:
- A real headless-Chromium test of the steel-style path (spawn -> CDP screencast
  frames -> input dispatch -> open a 2nd tab -> active-tab follow). It skips when
  Chromium isn't installed (CI runners without the deferred-install), so it never
  fails for lack of a browser; it runs on a host/compute that has Chromium.
- A browser-use-free test of the run-agent event stream + human take-control
  preemption, with Agent/ChatAnthropic mocked so it runs everywhere.
- HTTP-layer tests of the fleet endpoints (list / task stream / release / cap)
  via Flask's test client, with run_agent stubbed (no LLM, no browser). These reach
  session.py coroutines through the bridge loop (started once by the conftest fixture).
- A boot-a-server integration test of the cast WebSocket + disconnect-as-lease over a
  real socket, against a fake session (no real Chromium).
