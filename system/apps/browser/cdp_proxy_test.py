"""The gated CDP endpoint's own contract.

These cover the guarantees §11 of the handover plan calls load-bearing, without needing a
real browser: the discovery rewrite (nothing may leak the upstream port), the block list,
the last-page guard, and -- the acceptance criterion for the whole change -- that losing
the lease refuses the agent's very next frame while leaving its socket alive.

Why "leaving the socket alive" is asserted rather than assumed: a `@playwright/cli` slug is
poisoned the moment its socket drops (measured -- it never rebinds and disappears from
`playwright-cli list`), so closing the connection on takeover would permanently brick the
browser for the agent. Refusing frames was measured to recover cleanly.
