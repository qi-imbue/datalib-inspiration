# browser

A per-workspace fleet of live Chromium browsers with a single atomic ownership
model: each browser is controlled by exactly one party at a time (a specific
agent, identified by its `MNGR_AGENT_ID`, or the human).

- **Daemon** (`browser-service`): a Flask + flask-sock service (synchronous,
  thread-per-connection) that owns every browser. browser_use, Playwright (async),
  and the per-browser ownership state machine run on one background asyncio event
  loop, reached from the Flask threads through a single `run_coroutine_threadsafe`
  bridge. Each browser is a **headful** Chromium (under an Xvfb virtual display, so
  it has a real X11 clipboard for native copy/paste -- see `_HEADLESS` in
  `session.py`) driven by `browser_use.BrowserSession`, observed over the same CDP
  endpoint to stream a live view (`Page.startScreencast` -> base64 JPEG frames over
  a WebSocket) and inject human input. Each browser is
  addressed by a random ~2-word english NAME (e.g. `alex-smith`), generated on
  demand and never reused; the fleet starts empty and there is no default
  browser.
- **Ownership** is one locked, compare-and-set state machine per browser. Agents
  never preempt each other -- a second agent waits in a FIFO queue
  (monitor-and-wait). The human can take control from the UI at any time, which
  always wins and pins the browser to the human. For direct control ownership is a
  sticky lease (acquired on the first command, re-checked before every command, and
  auto-released when idle); for `task` it is bound to the live request connection.
- **CLI** (`agentic-browser-fleet`): the thin client the agent uses to drive the
  fleet. The fleet starts empty, so the first step is always `new` (it prints the
  random name of the browser it started); every other command takes that
  `<name>`. Primary path is **direct control** -- `state <name>` shows the page as
  a numbered list of clickable elements, then `open`/`click`/`input`/`scroll`/
  `keys`/`screenshot`/`tab` act on it (lifting browser-use's own executor against
  the live session). The agent does its own reasoning, so no API key is needed.
  `ls [--include-tabs]`, `new`, `acquire`/`release` round it out. An optional
  `task <name> "<goal>"` delegates a whole goal to an autonomous browser-use agent
  (the one path that needs a key). See the `agentic-browser-fleet` skill.
- **Viewer** (`assets/index.html`): a viewer-only page (no in-tab chat). It shows
  the live browser and, when an agent is driving, a grey "Agent has control"
  overlay with a "Take control" button; the agent's trace lives in the agent's
  output, not the tab.
- **Persistence**: the fleet survives a workspace stop/restart. Each browser gets
  its own persistent Chromium profile under `$MNGR_HOST_DIR/browser-profiles/`
  (Tier A -- on the workspace volume), so cookies/logins/history come back; Chromium
  does this itself, we just point `user_data_dir` at a durable dir. A tiny manifest
  (`data/.state/browser-fleet.json`, Tier B -- covered by the opt-in GitHub sync)
  records which browsers existed and their tab URLs, so even a full rebuild restores
  the tab list (logged out, since profiles are volume-only). On daemon startup the
  fleet is restored **eager-sequentially** (one browser at a time, no cold-boot
  memory spike) behind an **init gate**: state-changing commands return a 503
  "initializing" until restore finishes, while `ls`/`state` stay open. A fresh
  workspace starts with an empty fleet (no default browser); the first `new`
  creates one. `close <name>` retires a browser and forgets its profile; a
  crashed browser is never restored as healthy.
  - The profile dir name contains the literal `browser-use-user-data-dir-` substring
    on purpose -- it makes browser_use's `_copy_profile()` use the dir in place
    instead of copying it to a temp dir (which would silently defeat persistence).
    Pinned by `browser-use==0.13.1` and guarded by an integration test.
- **Memory shedding** (`oom_retag.py`): the daemon is tagged as the most
  expendable thing in the workspace, but Chromium overwrites the inherited
  `oom_score_adj` with its own values, which would leave renderers more
  protected than the agents they serve. Every fleet event that can spawn a
  Chromium process (launch, new page -- from any origin, including a human in
  the viewer -- and navigation) triggers a short burst of sweeps on a daemon
  thread that remaps Chromium's self-assigned values back into the browser
  band, preserving their relative order. See "The Chromium exception" in
  `system/services/oom_priority/README.md`.
