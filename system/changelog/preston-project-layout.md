Update `system/scripts/layout.py`'s help for the workspace's views.

The workspace no longer shows a named layout. It shows one *view* at a time: either a project — a filter over the machine's chats, terminals, browsers, apps and pages, plus its own dockview arrangement — or `Everything`, the unfiltered home that every object appears in, including objects filed in no project at all. A connected browser client reports whichever view it has open, and that is the thing a layout op can target.

The `--layout` help and the module docstring now say so: mutating ops name the view a client is in (`context` reports it), `Everything` is a valid target even though it is not a project, and the older named layouts (`desktop` / `mobile`) still resolve for compatibility even though nothing keeps one active.

Nothing about the op set or the failure modes changed. A mutating op still fails with a clear error listing the connected clients when none of them has the named view open.

The `rename` op's help now says what rename actually does: it names the object machine-wide through the workspace's member-titles store, so the title shows in every view, not just one panel's tab.

Let an app register its own icon.

`system/scripts/forward_port.py --name <name> --url <url>` now accepts an optional `--icon` (the SVG markup itself) or `--icon-file` (a path read once, at registration time, whose *contents* are stored). The registry keeps the markup, not a path: a path would have to be readable, at render time, by every consumer of `apps.toml` — the system-interface server, the desktop client, anything reading it off a shared host — and those do not share a filesystem view with the service that registered.

Because the markup ends up inlined into the workspace's DOM, it is validated before it is stored: it must parse as exactly one well-formed `<svg>` element with nothing that executes (`<script>`, `on*` handlers, `javascript:` URLs), nothing that restyles the host document (`<style>`), nothing that embeds foreign content (`<foreignObject>`), and no reference to anything outside the icon itself. XML declarations, doctypes, comments and CDATA are refused outright rather than tolerated, and the markup is capped at 16384 characters so one app cannot bloat a registry every consumer re-reads on every change. A rejected icon fails the registration loudly instead of landing half-registered.

Registering without an icon flag leaves whatever icon the app already registered untouched, so a service that re-registers on every restart — the normal supervisord case — does not silently fall back to the generic glyph. Passing an icon again replaces it.

Let a service register a port without becoming an "app."

`forward_port.py --internal` marks the entry so the workspace still routes to it (share, forward) but never offers it as something to open — no row in the New Tab launcher's machine table, the rail's All apps popover, or its shortcuts. This is for machinery with a port but no page of its own, like `owner-exec`'s loopback exec server: registering it plainly put a name with nothing behind it in the launcher, which opened blank. Unlike `--icon`, the flag has no tri-state to preserve — a service's own registration call either always passes it or always omits it, so every re-registration sets it outright rather than needing a "leave it as it was" case.

owner-exec registers itself with `forward_port.py --internal` (the launcher script passes the flag itself rather than letting the daemon register plainly): it has a port to forward -- the share gateway and the desktop's forward route through it -- but no page of its own, so a plain registration put it in the workspace's app list as an openable app that opened blank. The `vm-exec` registration gets the same flag for the same reason.

`system/scripts/layout.py` speaks views natively: `--view` is the documented flag (`--layout` remains as the same flag under its old name), mutating ops no longer require a target -- an op naming none goes to the view the connected client is looking at -- and `list` / `inspect` / `where` accept `--device desktop|mobile` to read a view's per-device arrangement. `load <view>` switches the client onto a project or Everything, and the module docstring and subcommand help describe projects rather than the retired named layouts.

`layout.py views` lists the machine's views: every project plus Everything, with members, per-device content presence, which connected clients are on each, and the last-active view id.
