Added `system/scripts/imbue_plan_extra/`: the plan recorder the `build-app`
skill fires off: a shared `write_plan.sh` wrapper plus a per-flow prompt under
`prompts/`, named by the wrapper's first argument, so a second skill can record
its own plans by adding a prompt and one invocation line. It records, for offline
analysis, a routing plan for the same request. Nothing in the workspace reads the
result.

The plan is written by `--model opus`, which on the pinned Claude Code (2.1.227)
is Opus 5 -- the same model the workspace's own chat agent runs on. The alias
rather than an exact id, so the recorder follows the workspace's Opus instead of
being held on one model after the workspace moves.

The plan is written in the conductor three-list form -- `capability`,
`subtasks`, and `access list`, one entry per node, three to fifteen nodes. Nodes get
a capability bucket (`low` / `medium` / `high`) rather than a named model, on
the assumption of a spectrum of general-purpose models with a cost tradeoff.
Each node's access list names the earlier nodes it depends on, so nodes with
empty access lists are independent and run in parallel. The plan writer reads
`build-app` first and routes the work that skill describes.

Each call gets its own directory,
`data/.imbue/plans/<utc-timestamp>-<agent>/`, holding `request.txt`, `plan.md`,
a `meta.json` of ids and timings, and that run's `log`. The wrapper prints the
directory it created as its only output, so a `write_plan.sh` call in an
agent's transcript maps straight to its results. build-app therefore tells the
agent to run the command exactly as written, with nothing piped, redirected or
chained onto it: decorating the call swallows that line, and a pipe to `head` or
`tail` is refused outright by the `agent_block_pipe_tail_head.sh` pre-tool hook,
costing a denied call and a retry.

The recorder is built to be invisible to the work going on around it:

- It returns immediately -- the first invocation re-execs itself detached, so
  the calling agent never waits and never sees a failure.

- The detached child is a plain headless claude, not an `mngr` agent. An
  `mngr create` agent would show up in the workspace's agent list (the UI hides
  only `is_primary=true` agents), would pay for provisioning on every
  `build-app` call, and would have to be destroyed afterwards.

- It runs with `--setting-sources user`, so none of this repo's project hooks
  fire for it -- in particular the SessionStart `uv sync --all-packages`, which
  would rebuild the venv underneath the agent that spawned it. That flag also
  suppresses project skill discovery, which is why the instructions are fed in
  as the prompt rather than invoked as a slash command.

- Its tools are `Read,Grep,Glob`. The plan comes back on stdout and the script
  writes the file, so the child has no tool that can touch the workspace. The
  script prepends a fixed "do not use this plan" header, which therefore
  appears regardless of what the model did with its instructions.

- It unsets the spawning agent's `MNGR_*` and session environment, runs under
  `nice`, tags itself into oom_priority's `AGENT_SUBPROCESS` band, and is
  capped at 15 minutes.

`data/.imbue/plans/` now ships with the template, described in `data/README.md`
alongside the analytics footprint it shares the `data/.imbue/` bucket with. And
`agent_require_steps_pretool.sh` exempts the recorder, so it never nudges the
agent to declare a step for something the user must not be shown.
