Added OpenAI Codex CLI support to the workspace image.

- Installed another coding-agent CLI into the image so it can run as a peer
  harness: Pi (`pi` 0.83.0, npm). Its mngr plugin is registered in
  `build_workspace.sh` (tool `--with-editable` + `mngr plugin add`), with the
  pinned version as a `Dockerfile` ARG.
- Node.js is now a pinned, sha256-verified nodejs.org tarball (Node 22 LTS) installed
  to `/usr/local`, replacing the trixie apt `nodejs` (Node 20). Pi's bundled `undici`
  calls a `worker_threads` API absent on Node 20 and crashes at import, so Node 22 is
  required; codex/the frontend build are unaffected.
- `.mngr/settings.toml`'s codex block now inlines its `config_overrides` on the
  agent-type block instead of a separate `[...config_overrides.features]` table (same
  resolved config, one place to read).
- `.mngr/settings.toml` no longer carries per-harness create templates
  (`[create_templates.claude]`, `[create_templates.codex]`). Each held only
  `type = "<harness>"`, which the create path now passes as `--type <harness>`
  directly, so the blocks were redundant. Harnesses are selected by `--type`; role
  templates (`chat`, `worker`, ...) still stack on top and never name a harness.

- Bake codex 0.146.0 into the image (CODEX_VERSION). This is the version the codex
  tool-label table and the `code_mode_host` feature check were confirmed against.
- Ship a repo-committed codex private-instructions channel at .codex/AGENTS.md,
  provisioned as codex's global instructions without polluting the shared
  AGENTS.md every harness reads.
- Pull in the codex agent-type dependencies (imbue-mngr-codex).

- The `worktree`, `worker`, and `subskill-worker` create templates now run `uv sync --all-packages` as an extra provision command (cwd = the fresh worktree, before the agent launches). All three land the agent in a fresh git worktree with no `.venv`, so the agent's first `uv run` previously cold-built one mid-task with root-closure scope, racing the agent's own commands. Pairs with the bootstrap's boot-time venv converge for the shared work_dir (which covers the chat/chat_codex agents and the services).

- Restored the faithful AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md split from the original `add-codex` design: CLAUDE.md is again the pure Claude delta (`@AGENTS.md` include + the TodoWrite/tk claudism, the `.claude/skills` symlink note, and the Memory section, refreshed to the `data/memories/` layout and the restic host-backup survival story). The codex-V1 redo had kept the `@AGENTS.md` header but left the entire generic body inlined below it, so Claude read the shared content twice. Verified line-by-line that everything removed from CLAUDE.md exists in AGENTS.md (verbatim or as the original deliberate genericizations).

- Create templates split into two orthogonal kinds, stacked at create time as
  `mngr create <name> -t <harness> -t <role>`. A **harness** template (`claude`, `codex`)
  sets only `type`; a **role** template (`chat`, `caretaker`, `automation`, `worker`) says
  what the agent is for and never sets `type`, so the same role runs under any harness.
  Adding a harness now costs one template instead of one per role -- previously `chat` and
  `chat_codex` were near-duplicates and the codex one had no output style at all.

- Roles express their system prompt harness-neutrally. `output_style` names the `name:`
  frontmatter of a file in `.agents/output-styles/` (moved there from
  `.claude/output-styles/`, which is now a symlink to it, mirroring `.claude/skills`);
  `append_system_prompt` replaces the hand-written `agent_args` flag pairs. Claude applies
  the style as its native `outputStyle` setting; codex, having no output-style concept, gets
  the same file's body as developer instructions. Codex chat agents therefore pick up the
  Engineering Subordinate style they previously lacked.

- `uv sync --all-packages` now runs for **every** agent, from `[commands.create]`, rather
  than being repeated in individual templates. Agents sharing the workspace work_dir were
  hitting missing-package failures the per-template converge did not cover.

- Removed the worktree agent mode: the "New agent" menu entry, the
  `POST /api/agents/create-worktree` endpoint, `CreateWorktreeRequest`, and the `worktree`
  create template. The `+` menu now offers "New chat" (claude) and "New Codex Agent" (codex),
  which are the same `chat` role on different harnesses. This does not affect
  `/home/user/worktrees/` -- worker sub-agents still run in their own git worktrees.

- Removed the `subskill-worker` template. Its only difference from `worker` was installing
  the generic `harden-worker` sub-skill, which `worker` now does for every worker; the
  crystallize / heal / update creation flows and update-system-interface use
  `--template worker`.

- Removed the `chat` and `worker` agent types. Both existed only to hang role config off
  `parent_type = "claude"`; that config now lives in the role templates, so every claude
  role resolves to the `claude` type itself.

- Codex tool-call labels rebuilt against the tool surface of a live agent on codex-cli
  0.146.0, whose signatures are now recorded verbatim in the module docstring.
  `apply_patch` is gated on the function name rather than on the patch header appearing
  anywhere in the program -- a shell command that merely mentioned `*** Add File:` used to
  render as `Tool: Edit` -- and its labels now name the operation, so a create reads
  "Creating hello.txt" and a delete "Deleting gone.txt" instead of both reading "Editing".
  Argument keys (`cmd`, `q`, `path`, `prompt`, `uri`, `server`) come from the real
  signatures, and the patch-header pattern stops at a newline so it works whether the body
  arrives raw or JSON-escaped.

- A `tools.<fn>` that is parsed but has no label now renders `Tool: <fn>` rather than
  collapsing to `Tool: Code`, which is reserved for a program with no parseable call at
  all. This is what makes a prompt-banned tool (`update_plan`, the goal trio) visible the
  moment it leaks, and a stale label table self-reporting.

- Labels added for `image_gen__imagegen`, `list_mcp_resources`,
  `list_mcp_resource_templates`, and `read_mcp_resource`; the hosted `web_search` path was
  removed, since it cannot occur under `code_mode_host`.

- Codex's turn-boundary markers now cross the wire as a declared `special` event type
  carrying a `kind`, instead of three bare top-level types the frontend had never been
  told about and silently dropped. `SpecialEventKind` (backend) and its TypeScript mirror
  are the one list of legal kinds, so an undeclared marker is a type error rather than an
  event that vanishes. Nothing renders them; they exist so `/events` reflects the true
  transcript and the activity latch has an authoritative signal.

- Session watching now goes through a harness registry instead of an inline branch. A
  harness is resolved once, at discovery, from mngr's agent type; `harnesses/registry.py`
  turns that into a watcher and an activity tracker, and `app_context` no longer names a
  harness at all. `AgentSessionWatcher` became a real interface both watchers implement
  (the claude one is now `ClaudeSessionWatcher`), replacing the type union, and its
  `build()` takes the whole agent record so a caller need not know that claude wants a
  config dir and codex does not. Adding a harness is one registry entry.

- Harness code now lives in one package per harness. `imbue/system_interface/harnesses/`
  holds the generic pieces (the watcher and activity-tracker interfaces, the registry, the
  shared label helpers, the event contract) with `harnesses/claude/` and `harnesses/codex/`
  beside them, each carrying the same file names -- `watcher`, `session_parser`,
  `activity`, `activity_state`, `tool_labels`. Claude additionally holds auth, fast mode,
  and model settings, because those exist only for claude; an empty slot in the codex
  package is the honest statement of that, rather than a branch in shared code. The
  activity ABC and its two implementations are now three files instead of one.

- The harness is a `HarnessType` enum rather than a bare string. mngr's `AgentDetails.type`
  is an open string that names non-harness agent types too (`main`, `wait`), so
  `harnesses/harness_type.py` holds the closed set plus the one `parse_harness` boundary
  that narrows it. Every field, registry key and parameter downstream is the enum, so
  `get_harness_spec` is total and its silent string fallback is gone -- an unknown harness
  is now resolved once, at discovery, instead of being re-checked at each lookup.
- `creation_type` no longer names a harness. It was `claude -> "chat"`, `codex -> "codex"`,
  which mixed a role with a harness; both `+` menu entries create the `chat` role and the
  harness travels beside it, so `creation_type` is always `"chat"` and the frontend union
  collapses to match. `HARNESS_CREATION_TYPES` is deleted, as is `HARNESS_AGENT_TYPES`
  (an identity map from each harness to itself).
- `AgentStateItem.activity_state` is typed `ActivityState | None` rather than `str | None`.
  The enum already existed; only the field and the two `.value` unwraps at its assignment
  sites were bare.
- The send endpoint's cold-start handling is tighter: one tri-state result instead of a
  separate still-starting flag, the timeout rationale left where the timeout is
  (`CodexAgent._TUI_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) rather than restated, and the delivery pool
  bounded at 8 workers so a burst of cold starts queues instead of spawning per send.
  No behavior change.
- The send endpoint is a plain synchronous send again; the worker pool, sync budget and
  202 branch are gone, as is the paired mngr-side ready-timeout override.
- Feature flags are set at process start and nowhere else. `enable_workspace_feature_flag.sh`
  is deleted: 293 lines whose every step -- rewriting supervisord's `environment=` line,
  reread/update/restart, waiting for the port, verifying the value reached the process,
  broadcasting a browser reload -- existed only to change a value the process reads once
  at exec. Set `FEATURE_FLAG_ENABLE_CODEX` at workspace creation instead; absent at
  startup means off for that container's life.
- The index shell's `no-store` header is dropped from this branch. It is unrelated to
  codex, and gabriel's default-workspace-template#349 lands the same header on the same
  function with tests and the refresh motion that actually needs it.
- The codex watcher warns instead of silently skipping a malformed rollout line, so a
  corrupt rollout is visible rather than quietly truncated. Satisfies main's new
  `prevent_silent_decode_error_catch` ratchet, which the old `debug`-level log did not.
- The codex watcher's read methods now refresh from the rollout on every call, where
  claude's already re-read their session files. Previously they served only what the
  background thread had parsed, so the first request after a system-interface restart
  could answer "no transcript" for a rollout sitting on disk -- and the client caches
  that answer, leaving the chat blank until a page reload while sends still worked and
  the model still had full context. The read cursor is now separate from the
  broadcast bookmark so a read cannot swallow events the live stream owes subscribers.
  Adds `harnesses/codex/watcher_test.py`; codex had no watcher test, which is why this
  shipped.
- Role templates state harness behaviour as agent-type settings rather than create options:
  `output_style = "..."` on `chat`, `append_system_prompt__extend = [...]` on the prompt-bearing
  roles. mngr routes a template key that is not a create option to whichever agent type the
  stack resolved to, so no role names a harness, and `__extend` makes stacked roles each
  contribute a block instead of the last one replacing the rest. Requires the vendored mngr
  synced here; the keys do not resolve without it.

- The shared PreToolUse command-rewrite guard (`system/scripts/claude_rewrite_bash_command.py`)
  gained a `--codex` flag. Recent codex (verified against codex-cli 0.146.0) rejects a hook that
  returns `updatedInput` unless it also carries `permissionDecision: "allow"`, so without the flag
  codex logged repeated `PreToolUse hook returned updatedInput without permissionDecision:allow`
  and the OOM self-tag + git-identity rewrite never applied. The flag adds that decision; claude
  runs the script without it (there a PreToolUse `allow` would auto-approve the tool and skip the
  permission prompt). The block guards are unaffected. See `system/scripts/POLICY_HOOKS.md`.

- The tk workflow-discipline guards (step-tracking reminder, non-standalone `tk start`/`close`
  block, open-steps carryover, stop nudge) now run on codex and pi too, not just claude, so the
  chat progress view is enforced identically across all three harnesses. Two shared scripts were
  hardened while wiring this: `claude_open_tickets_stop_nudge.sh` now guards its step count with
  `|| true` (it previously exited non-zero when there were no steps, breaking its "exits 0 always"
  contract -- and on codex an exit 2 on Stop re-engages the agent), and
  `claude_open_tickets_reminder.sh` gained a `--codex` flag that emits the reminder as
  `additionalContext` JSON (codex rejects UserPromptSubmit stdout that begins with `[`, which this
  reminder does). `POLICY_HOOKS.md` documents the full per-harness mapping.
