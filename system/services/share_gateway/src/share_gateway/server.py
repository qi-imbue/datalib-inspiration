"""The gateway's HTTP surface: caddy's forward_auth backend + the login callback.

Every request to a shared origin passes through ``/_auth/verify`` (session
cookie verified, email re-checked against the grants file, Origin policy
enforced, session cookie stripped from what the service sees). Visitors
without a session are bounced to the accounts broker and land back on
``/_auth/callback``, which verifies the broker's handoff token and sets the
workspace session cookie.
