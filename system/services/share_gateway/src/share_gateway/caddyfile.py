"""Caddyfile rendering: the share's TLS terminator + per-service host routing.

Caddy terminates the workspace's real TLS (cert + key from disk; frpc splices
relay bytes into its local HTTPS port), asks the gateway's ``/_auth/verify``
about every request (forward_auth), and routes by Host: each registered
service's unguessable ``<label>.<domain>`` origin to that service's local
backend, the dedicated ``auth-<rand>.<domain>`` label to the gateway's public
``/_auth/*`` surface (the login callback), and unknown-but-plausible service
origins to the gateway's auto-retrying loading page. The bare workspace domain
is intentionally unrouted (no frpc claim), so scanners that learn it from
Certificate Transparency reach nothing.

The certificate covers ``<domain>`` and ``*.<domain>`` only, so service
origins are one label deep on a share (deeper sub-origins are a deferred
follow-up, gated on wildcard-of-wildcard SANs).
