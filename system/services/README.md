# system/services/

Background services with no tab of their own -- most supervised by
supervisord, some driven by cron instead. They keep the workspace running --
backing it up, keeping tunnels alive, watching state -- without the user ever
needing to open them.

- `app_watcher/` - Watches the app registry (`data/.state/apps.toml`) and
  writes server events for discovery.
- `caretaker/` - The weekly Caretaker's deterministic check (cron-driven via
  `system/libs/automations/`, off by default; see the enable-caretaker
  skill).
- `share_gateway/` - The self-hosted sharing stack: while share materials are
  present it terminates the share's TLS in-container (caddy), enforces the
  owner's grants on every request, and keeps the outbound relay tunnel (frpc)
  up.
- `host_backup/` - Continuous restic backup of the whole host directory to a
  remote repository.
- `env_converge/` - One-shot environment convergence on boot (deferred
  installs at the pinned apt snapshot).
- `oom_priority/` - The OOM-prevention machinery: priority bands, the shed
  ledger, and the earlyoom integration.

Each is a uv workspace member (the `system/services/*` glob) with its own
README. A background service that exists solely to support one app does NOT
go here -- it lives in that app's folder under `system/apps/` and is named
`<app>-<role>`, declared in its own `system/supervisord.conf.d/<name>.conf`.
