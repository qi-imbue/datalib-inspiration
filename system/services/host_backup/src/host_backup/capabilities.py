"""Backup capabilities: what snapshot primitives this environment provides.

Capabilities are environment-derived facts, not configuration: the service
detects them in memory at startup by probing the container's filesystem, and
they are deliberately excluded from `data/system/backup.toml` (which holds only
user settings) and from the minds "backup service up to date" comparison
surface. They are logged and included in the backup events stream for
observability; there is no persisted capabilities file and no override
mechanism.

Detection decision tree (everything is probeable from inside the container):
  - If the trigger dir (`/mngr-snapshot/`) exists as a directory, we are
    inside a vps-docker agent container with the snapshot-trigger volume
    mounted -> `outer_trigger`. Snapshots cover the whole unified volume, so
    restic reads the `home/` subtree inside each snapshot (`read_subpath`).
  - Else if the backup root (`/home/user`, resolved through the provider's
    home symlink) is on a btrfs filesystem (lima), we can take snapshots
    directly via `sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot` -> `btrfs_local`.
  - Else (plain docker / any unrecognized provider) -> `direct` (no
    snapshot; restic reads the backup root live).
