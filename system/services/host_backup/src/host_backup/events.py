"""Structured event types + writer for the host_backup service.

Events land at `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR/events/backup/events.jsonl`, one
JSONL line per event, with the standard envelope (timestamp, type,
event_id, source) plus event-specific fields. The full stdout/stderr of
each restic command is embedded in the matching event so operators can
diagnose failures without rerunning anything.
