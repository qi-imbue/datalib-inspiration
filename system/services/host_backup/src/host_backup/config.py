"""Backup configuration loading: optional user settings + injected secrets.

Two on-disk inputs, both optional from the service's point of view:

- `data/system/backup.toml` -- purely *user* settings (interval, retention,
  excludes). Entirely optional: when absent the service runs on built-in
  defaults. Loading is deliberately tolerant: unknown keys (including the
  `[snapshot]` section old bootstraps keep writing forever) and malformed
  values produce log warnings and fall back to defaults -- they never crash
  the service and never block the remaining valid settings from applying.
  Rides the opt-in GitHub sync of runtime/ when that is enabled.
- `data/.secrets/restic.env` -- restic's repository address + all secrets
  (`RESTIC_REPOSITORY`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD`, and any backend credentials restic
  reads from the environment, e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for an S3/R2 backend). Written only by minds
  (injected whole); a missing file simply means backups are not configured.
  Gitignored.

Snapshot mechanics are NOT configuration: see `host_backup.capabilities`,
which the service detects in memory at startup.
