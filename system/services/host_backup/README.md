# host_backup

Background service that continuously backs up the agent's full `host_dir`
(`/home/user/.mngr/`) to a remote restic repository (Cloudflare R2 by default).

Distinct from the opt-in `github_sync` service, which only ships git commits
to a GitHub orphan branch as a fine-grained checkpoint. `host_backup` covers the whole
host_dir (code, worktrees, agent state, chat sessions, logs) and pushes to
an encrypted restic repo on cheaper object storage.

## Behavior

- Single long-running tick loop run as the `host-backup` supervisord program
  (defined in `system/supervisord.conf`, started by supervisord after `bootstrap`).
  Restart policy: `autorestart=true`.
- The repository is created (and keyed) by the minds app, not by
  host_backup: minds runs `restic init` from outside the workspace -- the
  workspace's own random password is the repository's single key -- and
  injects the resulting `restic.env`. host_backup just backs up to the
  existing repository -- it does not probe-then-init.
- Each tick reads two optional on-disk inputs:
  - `data/system/backup.toml`: purely *user* settings -- backup interval,
    retention, exclude patterns. Optional: when absent the service runs on
    built-in defaults. Loading is tolerant: unknown keys (including the
    stale `[snapshot]` section pre-refactor bootstraps keep writing) and
    malformed values are logged and skipped -- they never crash the service
    or block the remaining valid settings.
  - `data/.secrets/restic.env`: the repository address + all secrets --
    `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` (the only source of the repo URL), `RESTIC_PASSWORD`
    (this workspace's repository password), and any backend credentials
    restic reads from the environment (e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for an S3/R2 backend). Written only by the minds
    app (injected whole); a missing file means backups are not configured.
    `restic.env` is gitignored (rides nothing). `backup.toml` is *not*
    gitignored (everything under data/ is), so it survives via these restic
    backups themselves when
    that is enabled.
- A tick only runs once both `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` and `RESTIC_PASSWORD` are
  set in `restic.env`. Backend credentials are not gated by host_backup --
  restic reports its own error if the chosen backend needs one that is
  missing.
- Before the snapshot is taken, the tick runs `uv run env-converge capture`
  (best-effort, bounded at 120s) so the environment record
  (`~/.mngr/plugin/env-converge/`) inside the backup describes the packages
  installed at backup time. apt is already event-fresh via its
  `DPkg::Post-Invoke` hook; this refreshes the probe-based sources (npm
  globals, uv tools), which are otherwise only captured at boot -- without it,
  a restore onto a fresh base would silently drop anything installed since
  boot. A capture failure emits an `env_record_capture_completed` event with
  `success=false` and never blocks the backup.
- Snapshot method ("backup capabilities", detected in memory by the service
  itself at startup -- never configured; see `host_backup/capabilities.py`):
  - `btrfs_local`: take a `sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r` directly into
    `<btrfs-mount>/snapshots/current/` (lima).
  - `outer_trigger`: write a `request.json` into `/mngr-snapshot/` (a
    docker volume shared with the outer VPS) and wait for the outer
    `snapshot_helper.service` to drop a matching `result.json` (vps-docker).
    Each tick snapshots into a uniquely-named path
    `<btrfs-mount>/snapshots/<timestamp>` -- never a reused path. Under the
    sandbox's file gofer a reused path serves a stale, deleted subvolume, so
    only the first post-boot backup would capture data; unique names avoid
    that. After the backup, the oldest snapshots beyond `max_local_snapshots`
    (default 5) are deleted by name via a `cleanup` request that carries the
    snapshot name as `target`.
  - `direct`: no snapshot; restic reads `/home/user/.mngr/` directly (plain docker;
    intended for testing).
- Restic is run with `--exclude` for each entry in `backup.toml`'s
  `excludes` list (default: `**/.venv`, `**/node_modules`, etc). Rust's
  regenerable caches (`~/.cargo/registry`, `~/.cargo/git`,
  `~/.rustup/toolchains`, `~/.rustup/downloads`) are excluded by default while
  the user-data parts of those trees (`~/.cargo/bin` binaries, config,
  credentials, rustup's `settings.toml`) ride the backup.
- After every successful backup, `restic forget --keep-hourly N --keep-daily
  M --keep-weekly W --keep-monthly O` runs (cheap, index-only). At most
  once per `prune_interval_hours` (default 24) we additionally run
  `restic prune` (the slow data deletion step); gated by
  `data/.state/last-restic-prune` (a timestamp file under data/, covered by
  the opt-in GitHub sync when enabled).
- The outer loop never exits. Every exception is logged with full traceback
  to loguru and as a `tick_error` event in the jsonl stream; the loop
  continues to the next tick.
- A hard `minimum_backup_gap_seconds` (default 60) gap is enforced between
  successive backup attempts, so a config that's being mutated constantly
  cannot spam restic / the error log.
- Stale-lock recovery: a `restic backup` blocked by an existing repository
  lock (e.g. an exclusive lock left by a dead PID from a prior container
  incarnation) triggers `restic unlock` -- which removes only *stale* locks,
  never one a live process holds -- and one retry. Without this, a single
  stale lock would fail every tick indefinitely.
- Repeated-failure escalation: consecutive failed ticks are counted (reset on
  any success). Once the count reaches a threshold (3), each failing tick also
  emits a `backup_repeatedly_failing` event and logs at error level, so a
  multi-day outage leaves a loud, durable signal rather than passing silently.

## Reactive config reloading

The script polls `backup.toml` and `restic.env`'s mtimes every
`config_poll_interval_seconds` (default 15). If either file changed since
the last reload, the next tick fires immediately (subject to the minimum
gap). While a tick is running, polling is suspended; the script re-checks
once on completion and starts the next tick if either mtime advanced
during the run.

## Manual trigger

`uv run host-backup-now` waits for any in-progress backup to finish (so
your latest changes are guaranteed to be captured), bumps `backup.toml`'s
mtime, then tails `events/backup/events.jsonl` for the triggered tick's
terminal event and prints it. Terminal means *any* event that ends a tick, not
just the two restic outcomes: a tick that never reaches restic
(`tick_skipped_due_to_missing_secrets`, `snapshot_failed`) or that dies in the
loop's outer catch (`tick_error`) resolves the wait too, so the command returns
as soon as the tick is over rather than waiting out its `--timeout`.

Exit codes let a caller that takes a backup as a precondition distinguish the
outcomes without parsing the event: `0` for `restic_backup_succeeded`, `3` for
`tick_skipped_due_to_missing_secrets` (backups are not configured, so there is
no restore point), `1` for any other tick outcome, and `2` when no outcome was
observed at all -- either no terminal event arrived before the timeout, or the
events log could not be located in the first place (see below), in which case
nothing was triggered either.

The service writes its events under the *primary* agent's state dir (it
inherits `MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR` from the bootstrap shell that started
supervisord). A non-primary agent (e.g. a launched sub-agent) that runs
`host-backup-now` would otherwise tail its *own* state dir and never see the
completion event, so it would hang until `--timeout`. To avoid that, the
service publishes its resolved events dir to a host-stable pointer at
`$MNGR_HOST_DIR/host_backup/service_events_dir` on startup, and
`host-backup-now` reads that pointer (falling back to its own events dir when
no pointer exists yet, which is correct when the caller is the primary agent).

## Events

Structured events at `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR/events/backup/events.jsonl`:
- `capabilities_detected` (once at service startup)
- `backup_started`, `snapshot_created`, `snapshot_failed` (the snapshot step
  aborted the tick before restic ran), `snapshot_deleted` (one per deleted
  snapshot -- `outer_trigger` may emit several per tick during keep-N pruning)
- `restic_backup_succeeded`, `restic_backup_failed`
- `backup_repeatedly_failing` (escalation alarm after N consecutive failures)
- `forget_completed`, `prune_completed`, `prune_skipped`
- `config_reloaded`
- `tick_skipped_due_to_missing_secrets`, `tick_error`

Each restic command's full stdout / stderr is captured into the matching
`*_succeeded` / `*_failed` event for forensic debugging.

## First-run setup

In the minds app the whole `data/.secrets/restic.env` is written for you
when you pick a backup provider on the create form -- minds initializes the
repository (`restic init`, keyed solely by the workspace's own random
password) from outside the workspace and injects the file. To configure
backups by hand instead, populate
`data/.secrets/restic.env` with `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` (e.g.
`s3:https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<bucket>`), the backend
credentials (e.g. R2 access keys), and a `RESTIC_PASSWORD`, and initialize
the repository yourself (`restic init`) before the first tick -- host_backup
does not create the repository.

## Stable contract (minds backup-service updates)

The minds desktop app can inject a newer version of this service into a
running workspace by checking out `system/services/host_backup/**` at the `minds-v<X>`
tag matching the app version, committing it with the subject
`backup-update: minds-v<X>` (a convention like `update-self:` -- tools that
classify built-in vs. user code match on it), running `uv sync`, and
restarting the `host-backup` supervisord program. Tags are fetched from a
minds-owned `official` git remote that always points at the canonical
template repository (`https://github.com/imbue-ai/default-workspace-template.git`);
minds creates or repoints that remote idempotently, and the `upstream` remote
name stays reserved for the update-self machinery. Drift *detection* compares
against a fixed minimum required tag (bumped by minds only when a newer
service is actually required), so a workspace at or above the minimum is
never flagged even when the app is newer. For that mechanism to stay sound,
the following are stable contracts that must NOT be changed by edits to this
library alone:

- the `[program:host-backup]` block in `system/supervisord.conf`,
- this package's registration in the root `pyproject.toml` uv workspace,
- the `uv run host-backup` / `uv run host-backup-now` entry points.

Dependency changes are absorbed by regenerating `uv.lock` on the workspace
with a plain `uv sync`. `host_backup/config.py` additionally keeps no-op
backwards-compatibility shims for the names pre-refactor bootstraps import
at boot; they are removable only once all pre-refactor hosts have rotated
out.

## Restore

Out of scope for v1. To restore manually:

```
set -a; source /home/user/workspace/data/.secrets/restic.env; set +a
restic snapshots
restic restore <snapshot_id> --target /tmp/restored
```
