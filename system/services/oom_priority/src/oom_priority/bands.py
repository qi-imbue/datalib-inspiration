"""Memory-shedding priority bands and the helper that writes them.

Each process is assigned to one band by writing its ``oom_score_adj`` once at
startup. earlyoom reads ``/proc/<pid>/oom_score`` (the kernel badness, which
already folds in ``oom_score_adj``) to pick its victim, so a higher band makes a
process more likely to be shed first.

Bands are positive-only. A negative ``oom_score_adj`` (true "never kill") would
require ``CAP_SYS_RESOURCE``, which the container's default capability set does
not grant; positive values still establish the relative ordering. The never-kill
infrastructure (sshd, supervisord, earlyoom itself, tini, and tmux) keeps the
inherited default of 0 -- nothing needs to tag it -- and is additionally shielded
by earlyoom ``--avoid``. The supervisord services (the UI, the tunnel, the
terminal, the backups, ...) are tagged into the low ``SERVICE_BANDS`` range so
they stay well below the agent bands while remaining strictly ordered among
themselves.

Raising a process's own (or a descendant's) ``oom_score_adj`` is unprivileged,
so the tagging hooks need no special capability.

This module is stdlib-only (see ``paths``): it is imported by the agent-tagging
and subprocess-tagging Claude hooks, which run under a plain ``python3``.
