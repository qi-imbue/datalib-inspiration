"""The agent-pid registry: maps an agent's main process pid to its identity.

earlyoom's after-kill hook is handed only the killed pid, uid, and process name
(comm) -- and by then the process is gone, so it can't inspect ``/proc`` to learn
which agent it was. An agent's main process is a ``claude`` process whose comm
("claude"/"node") does not reveal the agent name. So each agent records its own
main-process pid here at launch (the launch wrapper, ``system/services/oom_priority/bin/claude_oom_launch.py``,
calls ``record_agent_pid`` for its own pid just before it execs claude); the kill
hook looks the killed pid up to decide whether an *agent* was shed (which drives
revival) versus a mere subprocess.

One file per pid (``<pid>.json``) rather than a shared map, so concurrent agents
never race on a single file and no locking is needed. Stale entries (whose pid
has been reused or is simply gone) are pruned best-effort by writers.

Stdlib-only (see ``paths``): imported by the launch wrapper and the kill hook
under a plain ``python3``.
