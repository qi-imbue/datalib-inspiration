"""The app registry as the memory backstop reads it: each registered app's
``priority`` band name, keyed by the supervisord program that runs it.

``data/.state/apps.toml`` is written by ``system/scripts/forward_port.py``,
which copies ``priority`` and ``program`` from the app's manifest
(``system/apps/<package>/app.toml``; see ``system/libs/app_manifest``). Only
those two keys matter here, so this is a deliberately narrow, stdlib-only
reader rather than the library's full row model: like every module in this
package it is imported under a plain ``python3`` (the backstop event listener).
