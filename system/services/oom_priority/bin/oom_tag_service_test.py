"""Tests for the service launch wrapper.

The wrapper sets its own memory-shedding band from a named service key, then
execs the service command with its args untouched. We verify the exec + arg
forwarding end to end via a subprocess with a fake command that records what it
was run with, and -- on a host with a writable ``/proc/self/oom_score_adj`` --
that the band is actually applied and survives the exec.
