"""Supervisord event listener: backstop every service's memory-shedding band.

The primary tagging mechanism is the ``oom_tag_service.py`` command prefix,
which puts a service in its band at spawn, before anything it runs exists (see
``system/services/oom_priority``). This listener closes the gap the prefix cannot: a
program whose command omits the prefix would keep the inherited
``oom_score_adj`` of 0 and sit as protected as sshd/supervisord -- an unknown
process must default to being expendable, not protected. Subscribed to
``PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING`` (fired at boot and on every restart), it resolves each
program's expected band (``bands.supervisord_program_band``: a built-in's own
band, the user-service band for anything unrecognized) and raises the process up
to it.

The RUNNING event fires only after a program has stayed up ``startsecs`` (~1s),
so the process may already have spawned children that inherited its untagged
value; those are found via a ``/proc/<pid>/task/*/children`` walk and raised
too. Children spawned after the tag inherit it.

The write is raise-only -- it makes a process more expendable, never less: a
process that tagged itself higher (the shared browser at the ceiling) is left
alone, and programs whose expected band is ``PROTECTED`` (earlyoom, this
listener itself) are never touched. Raising is also the direction that needs no
capability.

stdout carries the supervisord event-listener protocol (READY / RESULT
handshakes) and nothing else; diagnostics go to stderr. Every event is answered
OK: tagging is best-effort, and a FAIL would only make supervisord rebuffer and
replay an event we can do nothing more with.

Self-contained beyond the stdlib-only ``oom_priority`` package (imported via a
``sys.path`` insert), since supervisord runs this under a plain ``python3``.
