"""SessionStart hook: tell a revived agent it was stopped for memory pressure.

When earlyoom sheds an agent's own main process, the kill hook records it in the
shed ledger. The agent stays down until the user (or its lead) next messages it,
which restarts the claude process and fires this hook. The hook looks for shed
records naming this agent that have not yet been acknowledged, prints a notice
(SessionStart stdout becomes session context), and appends a delivery marker so
the same notice is not injected again.

Self-contained beyond the stdlib-only ``oom_priority`` package (imported via a
``sys.path`` insert), since claude runs SessionStart hooks under a plain
``python3``.
