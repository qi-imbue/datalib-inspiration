"""The plain-python3 scripts insert package paths into sys.path by hand.

Those inserted paths are invisible to the venv-backed pytest runs (the same
packages are installed in the workspace venv), so a stale path only explodes
at runtime under a bare ``python3`` -- which is exactly how every claude
launch runs ``agent_oom_launch.py``. Assert that every inserted path in
every plain-python3 script -- the oom_priority entry points here in ``bin/``
and the remaining hook scripts in ``system/scripts/`` -- resolves to a real
directory, so a package move cannot silently break agent startup again.
