"""Agent launch wrapper: tag this process's memory-shedding band, then exec claude.

Set as the claude agent type's ``command`` in ``.mngr/settings.toml`` so it
becomes the process mngr runs in the agent's tmux pane. It sets its *own*
``oom_score_adj`` to its priority band and records its pid in the agent-pid
registry, then ``exec``s the real ``claude`` with the exact arguments mngr
appended (``--settings``, ``--resume`` / ``--session-id``, etc.).

Because it execs in place, the band-tagged process *is* the claude process (same
pid -- ``oom_score_adj`` and the pid both survive ``execve``), so every
subprocess claude later spawns inherits the agent band by default; the PreToolUse
hook raises those subprocesses the rest of the way to the most-expendable band.
Because the process tags itself at launch, the band is set before any subprocess
exists -- the process that needs tagging is known directly, with no process tree
to inspect.

The band comes from the agent's label, resolved from ``MNGR_AGENT_NAME`` + the
host records (see ``agent_identity``): a chat starts maximally expendable and is
protected later by live UI engagement; a worker or an unidentifiable agent starts
at the least-protected agent tier.

Tagging is best-effort: any failure (no writable ``/proc`` -- e.g. macOS -- or
host records that can't classify the agent) is swallowed so it can never block
the agent from starting. Exec is mandatory: if ``claude`` can't be launched the
failure propagates, since the agent cannot run without it.

Self-contained beyond the stdlib-only ``oom_priority`` package (imported via a
``sys.path`` insert), since this runs under a plain ``python3``.
