"""earlyoom after-kill hook: record each shed process to the shed ledger.

earlyoom runs this (its ``-N`` script) once per kill, passing the victim's pid,
uid, and process name (comm) in the environment as ``EARLYOOM_PID`` /
``EARLYOOM_UID`` / ``EARLYOOM_NAME``. By the time it runs the process is already
gone, so we cannot inspect ``/proc`` for it -- instead we look the pid up in the
agent-pid registry to decide whether an agent's own main process was shed (which
later drives that agent's revival notice) or merely a subprocess.

Self-contained beyond the stdlib-only ``oom_priority`` package, which it imports
by putting that package's ``src`` on ``sys.path`` -- earlyoom invokes this under
a plain ``python3`` (the supervisord service environment), where ``uv`` and
third-party packages are not on hand.
