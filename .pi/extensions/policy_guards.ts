// payload on stdin; pi has no shell-hook surface, so it gets them here instead. pi
// auto-discovers `.pi/extensions/*.ts` from the project, and every extension's
// `tool_call` handler runs -- so this loads alongside mngr's own lifecycle extension
// and either may block.
//
// Each checker takes the agent's command as $1 and exits 2 to refuse it, with the
// reason on stderr. `match` keeps a checker off the commands it has nothing to say
// about, which matters because every entry here costs a process per bash tool call.
//
// See system/apps/chat/imbue/chat/harnesses/core-contracts/tool-call-policies.md for what each one enforces and how the harnesses
// harnesses reach it.
